         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The note is of ſpeciall weight in our Chriſtian experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and therefore let us take ſo much the more care in opening of it; <hi>He that findeth me</hi> (which is all one with, hee that hath me) <hi>he hath life,</hi> Prov. 8.34. <hi>but he that is eſtranged from me, he loveth death,</hi> ver. 36.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117852:5"/>learned Chriſt, if ſo be you have been taught by him as the truth is in Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For further clearing of this point, let me ſhew you firſt the Reaſons upon which it depends, and then the uſes of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Creatures broken Siſterns without Chriſt.</note> 
               <hi>Reason</hi> 1. For the firſt; The firſt reaſon ariſes from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of all the body of the creature to give us life without Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1.4. <hi>It is not poſſible that the blood of bulls, and goats ſhould cleanſe the conſcience from ſinne;</hi> They are not a valuable recompence to God for the tranſgreſſions we have done by our tranſgreſſions; we had deſerved death, for which the death of the beaſts cannot make recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem themſelves</note> And beſides, ſhould we dye for our ſinnes our ſelves, our death would not free us from the puniſhment, for we are not able to overcome death, but ſhould for ever ſinke under it: If there had been a Law that could have given us life, then wee might have lived by it, but there is no ſuch Law as can give us ſpirituall life. <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes in the name of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.29. It is the ſpeech of our Saviour, or of <hi>David</hi> in his name, <hi>No Man can keepe alive his owne ſoule.</hi> It is beyond the power of the creature to keep alive his own ſoule, no not ſo much as naturall life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7.9. <hi>No man can give a ranſome for the ſoule of his brother;</hi> no man is able to ranſome, or redeem his owne life or anothers; yea (which is much) <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, was taught to looke for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his inocent nature out of himſelf, for to that end did God give him the tree of life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9 the tree of life grows not in <hi>Adam,</hi> but in the Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now he that was to eat of the tree, called the tree of life, he was taught from thence, that the maintenance and continuance of that life which he then lived (a life of grace and glory) was not to be expected from his owne ſtrength, but from ſomething without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: The tree of life was a type of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the second perſon in Trinity, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. Now if <hi>Adam</hi> could not keep alive his own ſoule but by that tree, how much leſſe <hi>Adam</hi> falne and corrupted, being now become unable to keep that Law which in innocency he might have kept?</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:117852:5"/>
            <p> But more clearly ſee the grounds of this inſufficiency in the creature to helpe it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is taken from the preciouſneſſe of the price of our redemption. The coſtlineſſe of it, the matter of our juſtification is the price of our redemption, and without juſtification, no ſpirituall life at all. Now the price of our redemption is our juſtification, the forme of that juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Gods accepting of it, and imputing it to us; but the matter of it is the price of our redemption, and that is the root of all our ſpirituall life, the price of our redemption given to God is accepted of him, and by him given to us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.8. <hi>Precious is the redemption of ſoules;</hi> it is farre beyond the power of the creature, that which may be fit matter to give to God by way of ſatisfaction for a ſoule that is very precious, and this was onely the obedience of Chriſt to the death, he by ſuffering death for us, and riſing from the dead, declared himſelfe mightily to be the Son of God, and he by his obedience to the death, offered to God the price of our redemption; <hi>He gave himſelfe a ranſome for many.</hi> And this ſhews that it had beene impoſſible for any under the Sonne of God, to have given a ſufficient price for our redemption; neither man nor Angels could doe it: but he in giving a ſufficient price for us, did thereby mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelfe to be the Sonne of God, he onely by his death, is the matter of our juſtification, and his riſing is our life: the Father himſelfe, it could not ſtand with his juſtice to give a price for our redemption, he being the perſon offended; but the Sonne taking upon him our nature, that nature which had offended God, he by this meanes made atonement, betweene the Father and us, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king atonement declared himſelfe mightily to be the Sonne of God, none but he alone was able to tender to God ſuch a recompence as might be a ſatisfaction for our ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as this is ground why there is no ſufficiency in the creature to give us the life of our juſtification; ſo it is alſo taken from the root of our ſanctification and conſolation, for they ſpring both from one fountaine, and that is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117852:6"/>Spirit of Gods grace, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. he is the <hi>comforter,</hi> that is our <hi>ſanctifier,</hi> and this <hi>ſprings in us to everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 4.14 Now he that can give a ſpirit of ſanctification, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is onely the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unleſſe he goe away, and ſend the Comforter to us, he never comes. If you would know who it is that can give this water of life, you ſhal read, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. that it is only the Lord Jeſus; he it is only that goes to the Father, and ſends his Spirit of grace into our hearts, unleſſe he go to heaven, and ſend it downe from heaven to us, it is not given: So that he being the root of the Spirit of conſolation, &amp; of ſanctification, all this life of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation &amp; ſanctification ſpringing from the Spirit as from a fountain, and Chriſt being he that <hi>ſets open this fountain,</hi> Zac. 1.13. Therefore it is that there is an inſufficiency in the creature to ſhed abroad ſuch a thing as this into our hearts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2 33. when he was to give a reaſon of the ſpirit of Tongues, he fetches it fom the reſurrection of Chriſt, that he by his aſcending into heaven, <hi>did ſhed abroad this word which you now ſee and heare;</hi> ſo that by his death he gave to God, not onely the price of our redemption, but prevailed with the Father to beſtow upon him the Spirit to give where, and to whom he will.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And for a third ground, why eternall life cannot bee given by any but by Chriſt, is taken from the invincible difficulty of the paſſage to eternall life, from the hand of death and the grave, there is no redemption: <hi>What man is he that can deliver his ſoule from the hand of the grave?</hi> Pſal. 49. And if the ſoule be ſevered from the body: no man can quicken his owne ſoule, that is beyond the power and reach of the creature, death is the paſſage to eternall life, and this paſſage is of invincible difficulty, for a man to dye, and then to tranſlate himſelfe from death to life, is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the capacity of the creature, and therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life,</hi> Joh. 11.25. and hee ſpeakes of it formally and properly; as if he ſhould ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen from the dead my ſelfe, I riſe my ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore raiſe up others alſo; ſo that if you looke at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible difficulty of it, you ſhall ſee, that it onely is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117852:6"/>Lord Jeſus, that can give eternall life, it is a ſigne of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, when with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> we thinke this gift may be bought with money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2 It is taken from the good pleaſure of the Father, whom it hath pleaſed that <hi>in Chriſt all fulneſſe of life ſhould dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>And when he which is our life ſhall appeare, wee ſhall appeare with him,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. And therefore ſince God hath concluded, and ſhut up all the ſprings of life in Chriſt, and out of Chriſt there is nothing but death, the good pleaſure of the Father hath determined this point, that he having given us this eternall life in his Son, there is no deriving life from any fountaine, but only from the Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If upon our having, or not having of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends our having, or not having of life; then from hence you ſee an evident ground of triall of every one of our eſtates, whether we be alive or dead; would any man know whether he have, or not have life; conſider then whether you have, or not have Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And from hence you may diſcerne three grounds of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to diſcerne whether we have Chriſt or no.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider what it is to have a Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what it is to have the Son.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what ſignes there be of life; and hereby wee ſhall have direction, whether we have Chriſt or no, and by this, we may informe our ſelves aright in this particular.</p>
            <p>This point containes in it the pith and marrow of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, ſo far as any comfort of it may redound to us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then let us conſider what ſignes the Holy Ghoſt hath given us of our having of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We are ſaid to have Chriſt four wayes in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the honour, or ſervice, or worſhip of him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in ſome ſenſe wee are ſaid to have Chriſt by purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by way of Covenant.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by way of free acceptance, when God offers him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a man is ſaid to have God, or to have Chriſt, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117852:7"/>worſhips him, and the very worſhipping of him, is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him; ſo you read, Exod. 20.3. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods but me;</hi> it is the expreſſe words of the Commandement: And by having of God there, he meanes thus much, Thou ſhalt worſhip no other gods but me; worſhip me, and thou haſt me; worſhip any other, and thou haſt another god, and not me. So have the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by worſhipping of him; and you have him fully, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10, 11. <hi>He is the Lord thy God, and worſhip thou him;</hi> implying, that as God hath ſet over his Son to us, to be our Lord, ſo we muſt receive, accept, and worſhip him; this is that which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſung, <hi>He is my God, and is become my ſalvation,</hi> Exod. 15.2 <hi>He is my God, and he is my Fathers God, and therefore I will exalt him.</hi> So that to ſet up and exalt God in our hearts and lives, and to worſhip him, is all one; this ſets up the Lord, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, is to be our God.</p>
            <p>Now a little better to underſtand this point, that you may conceive what this worſhip of Chriſt is; you are to conceive that worſhip is performed to Chriſt, in minde, in heart, in life, both in our obedience that wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, in our life, in ſuffering, and patience which wee yeeld to God in our lives, by all this we worſhip Chriſt, and ſo have him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Part of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, viz. in the mind and judgement</note> Firſt, in our mindes, we then indeed worſhip Chriſt, when we have him in high eſtimation. The worſhip, and honour that we owe to Chriſt, is to have him in high eſteem, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5 10. <hi>She,</hi> the Spouſe there may well call him <hi>her beloved,</hi> Chriſt is my Chriſt, when he is to me the <hi>chiefeſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> Pſal. 89.6. <hi>Who among the ſonnes of the mighty can be likened to the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee:</hi> When the ſoule of a man doth eſteem of Chriſt above all other things in the world, when there is nothing that the ſoule ſo prizes as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then the ſoul hath him; and herin lies the difference between ſpiritual &amp; earthly things, you have an high eſteem of an earthly thing, and yet have it not; a man may highly prize a good bargain, and yet have it not: but no man ſets an high price upon Chriſt, but hee that hath him; ſpirituall things we wholly neglect, untill
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117852:7"/>we have them, and when we have them, then there oisn-thing with us comparable to them, untill a man have his portion in the word of God, it is but a thing of ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to him, and ſo the Spirit of Gods grace, and the blood of Chriſt untill a man have it; it is but a light vaine thing to him; yea till he have the Lord Jeſus himſelfe, no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thing is of any value with him; but ſo ſoone as ever the heart begins to prize Jeſus Chriſt, as the chiefeſt of all the bleſſings that ever God beſtowed upon the ſonnes of men; and if the ſoule thinke,<note place="margin">To prize Chriſt, is to worſhip him.</note> that had he but his part in Chriſt, he were the happieſt man in the world; in thus prizing him, he worſhips him; and in worſhipping him, hee hath him.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt conceive that all worſhip ſtands in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing another, with the debaſing of our ſelves; we humble our ſelves, that we may advance another. Now if our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement to them be ſuch as is not compatible to a creature, as when we ſubject our heart and ſpirits to them; this is divine honour: Now that ſoule that exalts the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as the higheſt in his owne eſteem, he debaſes himſelf to the duſt in his ſpirit before him, <hi>John</hi> 1.27. It is the ſpeech of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> (ſpeaking of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>He that commeth after me, is preferred before me, whoſe ſhooe latchet I am not worthy to looſe.</hi> This is a true worſhipping of Chriſt, when in compariſon of Chriſt he thinkes himſelfe unworthy to looſe his ſhooe latchet. No mortall man but hee may bee worthy to looſe any mans ſhooe latchet, if he be but worthy to live; but this is the honour and worſhip of Chriſt, that when thy ſoule looks upon Chriſt, he is ſo highly to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before him, as that he thinkes himſelfe not worthy to untie his ſhooe.</p>
            <p>Now when a man is framed to theſe thoughts in his minde, as that he looks at Chriſt as the chiefeſt of all the bleſſings of God, as the greateſt mercy that ever could befall a poor ſoule; and in reſpect of Chriſt, he looks at himſelfe as an unworthy creature, moſt unworthy of Chriſt, moſt unworthy to come in his preſence, and much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be made partaker of ſo glorious a match as the Lord
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117852:8"/>Jeſus is, or to have his part in his body and blood, the very worſhip of Chriſt, in truth, the having of Chriſt; if we have ſuch a ſingular eſteem of him, we may be ſure we could never have thus prized him, but that he firſt prized us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chriſtians worſhip Chriſt in their minds</note> For further opening this worſhip of Chriſt in our minds, becauſe it is of ſingular importance, and may helpe and ſtay a poore Chriſtian, when his heart may be moſt dead, and all other things fail him, yet this high eſteem of Chriſt in his mind is never wanting to an honeſt hearted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but he ever hath occaſion to looke at Chriſt as moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and at himſelfe in compariſon of Chriſt, as unworthy to looſe his ſhooe latchet.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Moſes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors the reproaches of Chriſt.</note> Let us therefore conſider a little further of it; you may the read the like gracious diſpoſition in <hi>Moſes;</hi> he ſo prizes Chriſt, that every thing belonging to Chriſt ſeems honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, <hi>he eſteemed the very reproaches of Chriſt, above all the treaſures of</hi> Egypt, and thoſe are leſſe, then a ſhooe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.26. in untying a ſhooe latchet, there is neither ſhame nor pain: but for a man to be reproached for Chriſt, if any thing be baſe and diſhonourable, ſure it is that: For a man that was taken to be the ſonne of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> daughter, and for him not to be aſhamed of the people of God: nor of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproached with them; yea, ſo far from being aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to think it <hi>greater riches, then the treaſures of Egypt,</hi> he was ſure gone far in his eſteem of Chriſt: that man truly worſhips Chriſt, that honors the reproaches of Chriſt above al other things.</p>
            <p>But yet there is ſomething more in it then this, in this worſhip of Chriſt in our minds: We honour, or worſhip Chriſt in our minds, when we make him the cheifeſt, and eſteem nothing more worthy to be knowne, then to know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternall to know thee the onely true God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> Now when the ſoul eſteemes nothing more worth the knowing then Jeſus Chriſt, this is an honouring of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> and Phil. 3 7, 8, 9, 10. He lookes <hi>at all things as loſſe, and droſſe, and dung that he might be found in Chriſt, not having his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117852:8"/>owne righteouſneſſe, but might know the power and vertue of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;</hi> This is that which the Apoſtle did prize in his Judgment as more honourable, and comfortable, then any thing under the Sun, and this was an evident ſigne that <hi>Paul</hi> had Chriſt; for this is an ordinary experiment in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no man hath any bleſſing,<note place="margin">Naturally men deſire to know the worth of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> but he would know the worth of it; if a man have <hi>a Farme or a yoak of Oxen, he will prove them, Luke</hi> 14.19. a man will know aforehand if he can, but when he hath it then he will prove it, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo is it with every one that hath the Lord Jeſus, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to prove Chriſt, he would know by experience, what the vertue and power of his death is, how it pardons his ſin, and mortifies his corruptions, and he would know the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his reſurrection: ſtrengthening and quickning grace in him, and the power of Chriſts aſcenſion,<note place="margin">He that hath Chriſt is inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to know all the vertue that is in Chriſt.</note> aſſending into the preſence of his Father, and ſitting at the right hand of God to rule all Creatures in heaven and in earth, for the Churches good, and ſubduing our enemies, and bringing us to glory in the end. A man that hath Jeſus Chriſt, he is inquiſitive to know all the vertue that is in Chriſt, &amp; he thinks in his mind, there is nothing better worth the knowings, then to know and feel the vertue and power of Chriſt Jeſus in his heart: And this is the firſt part of the worſhip of Chriſt, though we be yet doubtfull whether we have Chriſt or no; Yet it is an evidence to the ſoul, that thou haſt him; becauſe thou doſt worſhip him, and ſo highly prize him in thy minde, and if thou couldeſt but know him, and thy part in him, this is the chiefeſt comfort thou canſt pitch thy minde upon; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is thy beloved, ſince he is to thee the chiefeſt of ten thouſand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a man worſhips Chriſt,<note place="margin">Two parts of the worſhip of Chriſt is in the wil &amp; affections.</note> not only by an act of his mind, but a man hath Chriſt likewiſe when he hath him in the deep affection of his heart, when he deeply affects him in his heart, as his chiefeſt good. The former was an act of the Judgment and underſtanding; this belongs to the heart, will, and affections. <hi>Plal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, or in earth in compariſon of thee, and Pſal.</hi> 42.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Oh when ſhall I come, and appeare before him?</hi> this is ſuch a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, when a man wants Chriſt; As that it is called, <hi>hunger and thirſt, Matth.</hi> 5. ſuch a deſire as cannot be ſatisfied, but with meeting with that which the ſoul doth hunger and thirſt for; give an hungry man a houſe full of gold, and he is hungry ſtill, but give him meate and then you ſatiſfy him; So in this caſe, the ſoul that hungers after Chriſt, give him profit and pleaſure, and you give him nothing, but his ſoul is fit to periſh for want of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Deep mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt.</note> this is a deep worſhip we put upon Chriſt; and in ſo affecting of him, we have him; when the ſoul hath the Lord Jeſus, the higheſt and chiefeſt cauſe of rejoycing it hath, is, only its having of Chriſt <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. if he have his part in Chriſt, that is his <hi>Crown</hi> and his <hi>Portion,</hi> he counts it a <hi>goodly portion, his lot is falne into a pleaſant place;</hi> if we have him for our portion, we have enough, therein the ſoul is fully ſatisfied, and if we have loſt him, we chiefly mourne for that, our chiefeſt care is to get him; and we mourne moſt bitterly for want of him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. and we make it our deſire cheifely to have him, and then we truly have him when we ſo ſet him up in our hearts, we may affect many earthly bleſſings and want them, as gold and ſilver, and friends, and health, and yet want them all, but no man deſires Chriſt thus, but he hath him. I meane if he deſire him as his cheifeſt good, the having of any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing doth not ſo rejoyce his heart, nor the want of it ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him, ſuch a ſoul hath Chriſt.</p>

Eſa.</hi> 6.5.6.<note place="margin">Sweeteſt frame of Spirit.</note> this ſhal you ever finde to be the frame of the ſpirit of a chriſtian, the more deeply he affects Chriſt, the more inwardly he loaths himſelf, he looks at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as fit rather to be ſwallowed up of Judgment then ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any mercy, not only greive for his ſin againſt Chriſt or not only the more fear his ſin,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or the more be aſhamed of his ſin, by how much the more he ſees the glory of Chriſt, but he ſo much the more loathes himſelf, as one cleane out of heart, he abhors himſelf as an unclean &amp; abominable thing, that if he could go out of himſelfe, and be ſevered from his own ſoul, he would never own himſelf more, and therefore Chriſt puts <hi>ſelf denial</hi> for a principall part of his worſhip, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. this very denial of our ſelves is a worſhip of Chriſt, hereby we ſo affect Chriſt, that we are quite out of conceit and love of our ſelves. And ſo loath our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117852:10"/>ſelves for our ſins, as they make us unmeet to be joyned to ſo glorious an head as chriſt, and then indeed we have him.</p>
            <p n="3">3<note place="margin">3. Part of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of Chriſt.</note> A third part of this worſhip of him is in our life: And in our life we worſhip Him, by obedience in doing his will, and by patience in ſuffering his will, or any thing comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably for his ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vniverſall obedience.</note> Hearty obedience is a true and ſincere, and reall ſigne of this worſhip of Chriſt, and true ſincere obedience to him is a true having of him.</p>
            <p>This is, firſt when a man hath ſuch reſpect to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, as that there is none of them but he greatly delights in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect to all thy Commandements:</hi> He lookes at them all with ſuch reſpect, as the Commandements of a great God, he reſpects them all as Gods Commandements: When as a man is willing to take up every Commandement of Chriſt, he ſubmits to them all every one.</p>
            <p>And which is more, as he hath reſpect to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ſo he hath, reſpect to all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all his wayes, there is a double univerſality of obedience, and they both hold forth this truth; it brings into ſubjection every thought and Imagination to the will of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. now this is a marvellous ſubjection, that a man is not to dare to allow himſelfe in ſo much as a thought, unleſſe it be in a way of obedience to the will and Word of God, unleſſe a thought be ſuitable to the will of Chriſt, and allowable to the word of Chriſt, hee dare not accept it, when a man hath ſuch a profeſſed ſubjection to Chriſt, that as he reſpects every Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, ſo he would not be at his owne choyce, in ſo much as in any one thought, and this is ſuch ſolid and compleate worſhip of Chriſt as that a greater honor cannot be don to him, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.10, <hi>him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> he will not allow himſelfe in one evill thought, much leſſe will he allow himſelfe to ſpeak evill words, or leaſt of all, to do this or that evill in the ſight of God, ſo that this is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of him, when we ſubject all the paſſages of our heart and life to his will, <hi>we ſerve the Lord and not man, Col.</hi> 3.23.24. we do not any thing in our callings, but we do it in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt, and according to the rules of Chriſt, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117852:10"/>for the glory of Chriſt, and this is the ſervice we do to Chriſt, not a paſſage in our whole life, but we deſire to have reſpect to all Gods Commandements, and this is a right and true having of him.</p>
            <p>And as it is thus for our obedience in doing his will, ſo is it for our patience in ſuffering his will, there is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip given to Chriſt in patience, when as if ſo be it be the will of God to call us to ſuffer, we lay our hands upon our mouthes and ſit down and quiet our ſelves in this, that it is the will of Chriſt it ſhould be ſo, and being for the glory of his name, in the defence of his truth, and from his owne hand, it deares us not, we ſit downe quietly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of Chriſt as knowing whoſe hand it is that is upon us, it is a worſhip of Chriſt and we debaſe our ſelves to worſhip him, when we acknowledge that it is no matter what becomes of us ſo the will of God be done, this is true worſhip of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. it was a good Teſtimony of <hi>Elies</hi> ſincerity, when he heard of the wofull Judgment that God would inflict upon his houſhould; when <hi>Samuel</hi> had made an end of expreſſing the whole Judgement, ſaith he, <hi>it is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good in his owne eyes;</hi> wherein he fitly expreſſeth the poynt in hand; It is the Lord let him therefore do what he will, we have the Lord for our Lord, and he is a Lord to us, when we give him leave to rule us, <hi>the Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his name, Job.</hi> 1.20.21. this ſhewes the ſubjection of <hi>Jobs</hi> will to God. If he ſee it good to take all away as he ſometime ſaw it good, to give it all, this patient ſubmiſſion of the heart to God, is an undoubted argument, that we have the Lord for our God, had we not him for our God, the heart of man would ſo grudge at this &amp; that evill which befalls us, and would bitterly fall upon Inſtruments, and weary heaven and earth with our moanes and cryes. <hi>But I held my peace and ſaid nothing, for thou Lord haſt done it, Pſal.</hi> 39.19. a ſigne we have him for our Lord when in all his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, we acknowledge his good hand in it, and he is our Lord if we can ſo ſit downe and not murmure nor grudge againſt him, according to that you read <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.29 the church complaining of her miſery, he tells you the frame of her
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117852:11"/>ſpirit, in ſuch a temper the ſoul now <hi>ſits alone and keeps ſilence.</hi> He hath <hi>learned to bear Gods yoake,</hi> he is yoaked to the will of God; to his Commandements, to his providence, and he <hi>puts his mouth in the duſt if there may be any hope,</hi> he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lye downe under the hand of God, grudges not at it, but in quietneſſe and ſilence of heart bears Gods yoak, and God is then the God of our Salvation, when we <hi>keepe ſilence before him, Pſal.</hi> 62.1. this is a ſolemne worſhip of God when in the midſt of trouble, we can quietly ſit down, when the ſoul can ſay, <hi>I wil bear the indignation of the Lord, Mica</hi> 7.8, 9. when we ſee the Lords hand in all the puniſhments and Judgments that befall us, and we bear it willingly, this is ſolemnly to worſhip him, and to be wrought upon as clay in the hand of the Potter, and in thus doing we have him; And if the caſe ſhould be, that we ſhould come to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the name of Chriſt, it is ſo far off from being matter of murmuring to a Chriſtian man, as that he ſuffers not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patiently, but joyfully, and if <hi>any man ſuffer for the name of Chriſt as a Chriſtian, let him glorifie God on that behalfe, for the ſpirit of Glory and of God ſhall reſt upon him,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14.16. When a man thus worſhips God, patiently ſubmitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to him, and gives up himſelfe in his way, to be quieted by him, this is a true worſhiping of Chriſt, and whoever thus worſhips him, hath him, though we cannot yet tell whether we have faith or no, whether repentance or no, whether any true love to God or no, yet if we can finde this in us, that in our hearts we thus worſhip the Lord Jeſus, ſo highly prize him as the <hi>chiefeſt of ten thouſand &amp;c.</hi> In ſo doing we worſhip Chriſt and in worſhiping him we have him, but on the other ſide, if we ſo look at Chriſt as we can prefer ten thouſand other things before him, and can ſit downe quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without him, if we looke at Chriſt as a refuſe commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no worth the cheapening, and we looke at our ſelves as the great Omegaes of the world, and we would not have our names blemiſhed with ſeeking after Chriſt, but have greater buſineſſe then that to looke after, and we wil be our owne carvers; if ſo, then we do not worſhip Chriſt, and then we have him not, and ſo no redemption by him.</p>

            <p>And yet thus much I ſay, that many times without lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of mony, he cannot be had, without parting with money we cannot get him, the caſe ſo ſtands that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the holding faſt a mans mony lets go the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, you have a famous example in the young man,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117852:12"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.21. <hi>to</hi> 24. Where our Saviour ſhewes how hard a thing it is for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, becauſe it is hard for a rich man to part with all that he hath, when God calls for it at his hands, ſo that without mony ſometimes Chriſt cannot be had; And yet for mony he cannot be had, it was upon the point of mony, that the Lord Jeſus parted with the <hi>Phariſees, Luke</hi> 16.11.12. <hi>If you be unfaithfull with the mammon of iniquity, who will truſt you with true treaſure;</hi> if you uſe not outward things well, who will give you ſaving grace in Jeſus Chriſt? ſo that ſometimes for want of ſpending of money in a right way, many a man looſes the Lord Jeſus; ſo that though Chriſt cannot be had for money, yet ſometimes without expence of mony he cannot be had.</p>
            <p>For opening of this point there are three Caſes in which money muſt be layed out, or elſe Chriſt cannot be had, and in refuſing to lay out money, we refuſe life in him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Caſe.</note> Firſt, when the Lord by ſome ſpeciall command requires it, as was the caſe of the young man in the Goſpel, there was a ſpeciall commandement given to him, not given to every man, nor to every rich man, nor ſcarce any man in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe now adayes, yet then given to him; and now to ſtick for money, and rather loſe eternall life then his goods, in ſuch a caſe as this, he loſeth his life in Chriſt; and upon the ſame poynt, or the like, broke <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> it was the common reſolution of the Church of God in that Age to ſell all that they had, and to give to the poore, and to live after the ſame rate that other men did, a like proportion to every man; and to diſtribute faithfully to every man as every man had need, and as the Apoſtle ſaw cauſe; and when they come and keep back part of the price for which their poſſeſſions was ſold, you ſee how bitter a curſe from the preſence of the Lord fell upon them, they were cut off from the Congregation of Gods people, and it is much to be feared, cut off from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and from all hope of eternall life, and to ſtand as a terrible example to the whole Church of God, to ſhew what a dangerous thing it is to ſtand upon termes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117852:12"/>with Chriſt, and not to part with money for him; they could not have fellowſhip with the people of God, unleſſe they parted with all they had, and live upon the common diſtribution; but this caſe is not alwayes.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, there is another time, namely, when in caſe of perſecution the market of Chriſt goes at ſo high a rate, that a man cannot have Chriſt with any comfort in his ſoule, or peace to his Conſcience, or purity of heart or life, unleſſe he hazzard all his eſtate, or a good part of it: In buying and ſelling of a precious commodity, a good Chapman wil have it what ever it coſt him: So Chriſt is ſometimes at an higher, and ſometimes at a lower rate, but whatever he coſts him, he will have him; it is ſpoken in commendation of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>they ſuffered joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods,</hi> Heb. 10.34. to ſhew you, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it comes to that paſſe, that unleſſe a man be content to part with all his goods, he cannot have the recompence of reward, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to his ſoule; and therefore the Servants of God have been content to looſe all that they had, and willing to reſigne up all for the maintaining the integrity of their ſpirits, and the purity of their hearts and lives in the preſence of God, and then let all goe, they can <hi>ſuffer the ſpoyle of all joyfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 It is in caſe that by Gods providence you be caſt to live in ſuch Congregations, where you cannot have the Ordinances of God but at a great charge, as it is the caſe of many places, that unleſſe they be at charge for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpel it cannot be had; then we muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate freely that way, then <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked, for what a man ſowes that ſhall he alſo reap,</hi> Gal. 6.6, 7, 8 Where the Apoſtle doth encourage men at ſuch a time as this, when the Goſpel, cannot be had but at great charge, then lay out liberally for the Goſpel of Chriſt, and he calls it, A ſowing to the Spirit; as a man that layes out his money for an earthly commodity, for a good bargaine, he reapes corruption; ſo he that ſowes of the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reape life everlaſting. When a man layes out his money unto Spirituall ends, to obtaine the free paſſage
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117852:13"/>of the Ordinances of Chriſt, to enjoy the liberty of the Goſpel, he thereby ſowes to the Spirit, and ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting; for this is the bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto it, ſuch as ſo ſow, <hi>ſhall of the Spirit reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting;</hi> ſo that when a man out of a good and honeſt heart, and an hungering deſire after Gods Ordinances, ſhall be willing to be at charge for them, he hath this promiſe made to him, and it ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>He ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting.</hi> But yet, when a man hath layed out his money for this end, if he then thinke his money is worthy of Chriſt, he gets him not; but this is the firſt way of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt by way of Purchaſe, a ſeaſonable laying out our money for him as God requires it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is to be purchaſed, not ſo much by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as chiefly this purchaſe muſt be made by parting with all thoſe many and ſtrong Luſts, and Corruptions, and ſinfull rebellions of heart, by which we keep off Chriſt from comming into our hearts; this is that which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> directs us to, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. where he tels us what we muſt give for Chriſt, for ſinne is neither money nor moneys worth; but he makes a good bargaine that parts with his ſins, though he ſhould get no Chriſt for his parting with them. He ſpeakes of the firſt and principall part of the life of a Chriſtian man, the life of his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſprings from pardon of ſinne; let a man forſake thoſe ſins and luſts that he hath been moſt carried captive with; let a wicked man forgoe his thoughts and wayes, both his ſecret and open ſins, and let him <hi>then turne to God, and he will abundantly pardon;</hi> then God will receive him gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, to the juſtification of life. This is the thing that we muſt doe, this was the point upon which ſundry of them that have been hopefull for Religion, have broken off from Chriſt, and Chriſt from them; they have forſooke him, and he left them; <hi>Jehu</hi> ſtuck upon this very point, he would goe a great way, but when it comes (as he thinkes) to hazzard his title to the Crowne, then he will ſet up the <hi>golden Calves;</hi> when he ſaw that all muſt be parted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117852:13"/>with, rather then he would forgoe that, without which he could not maintaine his Kingdome, he would rather looſe Chriſt, then venture the loſſe of that, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.29.31. <hi>He regarded not to walke in all the Commandements of the Lord,</hi> and then as he cut ſhort with God in reformation, and did not fulfill to walke after the Lord, therefore God cut <hi>Jehu</hi> ſhort of all the hopes of grace that ever he might have attained, to verſ. 32. ſo that if we cut at a ſcanting with God, and will part with ſome luſts and corruptions, but not with others, then will God cut you ſhort of all your hopes of eternall life: and it was upon the ſame termes that <hi>Herod</hi> fell ſhort of Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.18. he had done many things according to <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry, but when God would cut him ſhort of <hi>Herodias</hi> his darling Luſt, that nothing might lye between God and him, but might now become fit for Chriſt, becauſe he would not cut himſelfe ſhort of <hi>Herodias,</hi> and cut ſhort his reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there, then this was added to all his other ſins, he <hi>ſhut up</hi> John <hi>in priſon,</hi> and afterward cut off his head alſo; ſo that when there is any ſinne, whether honour or pleaſure, or any comfort in this life, that men will not be content to cut themſelves ſhort of, it is the way to utter ruine; God will not be abundantly ready to pardon ſuch. And ſo was it with <hi>Daemas,</hi> when the love of money did ſo prevaile with his heart, after he had been much eſteemed of the Apoſtles, and mentioned honourably in their Writings, yet in the end it is ſaid of him, <hi>He hath forſaken me, and loved this preſent world,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.10. Love of the world had ſo prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with him, that he fell off from <hi>Paul,</hi> and from the Lord, whoſe Servant <hi>Paul</hi> was, and from fellowſhip in the Goſpel, and ſo did not finde Chriſt; this rule is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to be followed, and the care of it not to be neglected in any caſe, that our ſins are to be put out of our hearts and hands, as ever we looke to finde Chriſt, and life in him; notable is that expreſſion recorded in <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.10. to 16. the people come and <hi>cry to the Lord,</hi> to deliver them out of the hands of their enemies; but they had got to themſelves other gods, and now he would deliver them no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117852:14"/>more; When the people heard that, that God would not deliver them, and could finde no acceptance from him, ſo long as they continued in ſuch a ſinne; they thereupon goe and put away all their Idols, and leaves not one to be ſeen among them; and when God ſees that they had put them away, the text ſaith, <hi>that his ſoule was grieved for their miſery,</hi> and his bowels rowled within him for them, and he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them: So that when men are willing to fore-go their honourable ſinnes, their ſweet and delightfull ſinnes, their profitable ſinnes, and thoſe wherewith they have been moſt captivated; and he knowes one may as well pull their hearts out of their bellies, as ſome ſinnes out of them; but when he ſees men are willing to fore-go their moſt darling delightfull ſins, willing to breake off all impediments that ſtand between God and them, the Soule of God is grieved in ſuch a caſe, and it pitties him now that ſuch a ſoule ſhould be without him; and then it will not be long ere God ſtirres them up meanes of deliverance, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will reveale himſelfe unto them. Notable is that ſpeech, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3.8. when they <hi>take words to themſelves,</hi> and promiſe to leave all their evil wayes, whereby they ſinne againſt God, they make this requeſt to God, That <hi>he would take away their iniquities from them;</hi> and leaſt God ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, but be you doing ſomething in the meane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> time; they profeſſe, that for their owne parts they will ſet about the doing of their iniquities away, and they ſay; <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, and we will have no more to doe with them;</hi> wherein he ſhewes you, that God lookes not that only his people ſhall pray him to take away their iniquities, for we may pray ſo long enough, and not finde it done; but when we deſire God to doe it, and ſet our hearts and hands to it, and now with heart and hand ſay, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, nor will we ſay any more to the workes of our hands, Ye are our gods;</hi> then ſaith God in verſ. 4. <hi>I will heale their back-ſlidings, and will love them freely,</hi> &amp;c. God is then abundantly ready to pardon, when men forſake their owne wayes and thoughts, and throw away the ſins that hang about them, God will ſay of ſuch a people, <hi>I will heale them, and love them freely,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117852:14"/>mine anger is turned away from them.</hi> And you may preſume, when Gods anger is turned away, it is by and through Chriſt, or elſe there is no healing; and therefore in verſ. 8. <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaith, <hi>What have I to doe any more with Idols;</hi> the heart of a Chriſtian, or of a Nation, ſhall openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they wil have no more fellowſhip with theſe abominations; and then faith God, <hi>I have heard him, and obſerved him.</hi> God heares us, and underſtands what we ſay, and obſerves us well, and offers to be a covert to us from the ſtorme, when we begin ſolemnly to abandon ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, then he heares us, and anſwers us according to the deſire of our hearts; you have many a ſoule that cryes to God, Take away our iniquity, and many Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we put up to God to that purpoſe; and that ſometimes with many bitter moanes, but God heares it not; we pour out our plaints in vaine, and he regards it not; but when we come to God, and deſire him not only to take them from us, but begin to conſider our owne wayes and iniquities, and to put them from us, out of our hearts and hands, and we wil no more take ſuch bad wayes, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we have done; we <hi>will no more ride upon horſes,</hi> nor run to forreigne Princes for ſuccour; then God heares, and grants graciouſly whatever his poore people begge at his hands, and anſwers it according to all the deſire of their hearts, then the Lord preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> gives us the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and life and healing in him; and this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way of having Chriſt by purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God ſometimes requires that we ſhould part with all his holy Ordinances in ſome caſes; part with all confidence in them, and from ſtaying our hearts upon them; we may ſoone looſe Chriſt, and looſe his protection, and his fatherly compaſſion towards us, if in the uſe of the bleſſed Ordinances of God, we be not willing ſo farre to ſit looſe from them, as not to looke for life in the Word, or Sacraments, or communion with Gods Servants, but to looke for it all in Chriſt, not that God would have us caſt his Ordinances behind our backs, but therein to ſeek him yea, to <hi>ſeek his face evermore,</hi> and not to be barred from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117852:15"/>them, he would have a childe of God to count it his greateſt miſery, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.3, 4. Though God would have us to make account, <hi>That one day in Gods Courts is better then a thouſand elſewhere,</hi> Pſal. 84.10. yet God ſtill hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this, that he would not have us to truſt <hi>in the temple of the Lord,</hi> becauſe ſo to doe, is to truſt <hi>in lying words, Jer.</hi> 7.3, 4. Hold cloſe to the Ordinances, and by no meanes part with them if you can have them in any purity, and peace to your conſciences, but rather part with Princes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces then with them, but while you enjoy them, truſt not in them, nor thinke not to ſtand upon this, that you are bleſſed in regard of them; but looke at them all as loſſe, and droſſe, and dung, <hi>that you may win Chriſt.</hi> Looke not ſo wiſhly at the Priviledges of the Ordinances, truſt not in the outward letter of them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8. This is that which keeps off many a poore ſoule from comming on to grace; he lives in no open groſſe ſinne, and in the midſt of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, Chriſt is preached amongſt them; and therefore they conclude, that at the laſt day Chriſt will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and yet this wil then deceive them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23. Some iniquity reſted ſtill in their hands, for which he wil bid them depart from him, <hi>as workers of iniquity;</hi> they it may be, had ſome of them been themſelves Miniſters, and had done much good in the name of Chriſt, and <hi>called upon him, Lord, Lord,</hi> and yet but Hypocrites; which ſhewes you, that it is not the liberty of Gods Ordinances, and the diſpenſation of them that can ſecure us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truſt not in them, truſt not in this, that you are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Hearers, or that you can pray powerfully; truſt not in this, though you were Preachers of the Word of God, but truſt on him only for life, and ſalvation, and he wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deceive you.</p>
            <p>And as at all times we are to ſit looſe from the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in reſpect of our truſt, and confidence, ſo ſometimes we muſt be content to forgoe the Ordinances of God for Chriſts ſake;<note place="margin">Note this.</note> if we cannot enjoy the liberty of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but with ſinne againſt our ſoules, in this caſe the Ordinances of God are to be neglected, and omitted, if he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117852:15"/>cannot have them with innocency and purity to his ſoule, he muſt let them goe. All the good Prieſts that were wont to miniſter before the Lord in the Synagogue, throughout the ten Tribes, when they could not enjoy their places, but muſt worſhip <hi>the Calves,</hi> (though the Calves were very like the Cherubims) when they could not doe their ſervice to God, but they muſt ſerve ſuch Images as God had not ſet up there, thereupon all the honeſt and true-hearted Prieſts left their places, and would no more miniſter there, rather then be compelled to miniſter at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> 2 Chron. 11.14. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> caſt them out becauſe they would not doe ſo, and they were content to be caſt out, and ſold their Livings, and <hi>went up to Jeruſalem;</hi> To ſhew you, that ſometimes when Chriſt cannot be had, but we muſt forgoe the very Ordinances of God, <hi>becauſe we cannot have the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances without impure mixtures of humane invention; then let them goe, rather then defile our owne hearts and hands with ſinne againſt God.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7.8. <hi>Tell me where thou dwelleſt, and feedeſt thy flocks at noone;</hi> after the ſeparation was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> when the Mother Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was angry with the Church of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and caſt her off; <hi>tell me where thou lyeſt and feedeſt thy flocks, &amp;c.</hi> How ſhould I goe to the golden Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel?</hi> and worſhip there where God had never put his Name to be worſhipped? why, Chriſt anſwers them; <hi>If thou knoweſt not, O thou the faireſt among women,</hi> (as all ſuch Chriſtians are the faireſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong women) <hi>If thou knoweſt not where I reſt, goe forth by the foot-ſteps of the flocks, and by the Shepherds tents, and feed there.</hi> Have they not removed their tents to Jeruſalem? why goe after them, and feed with them; and this was fulfilled, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.16. The people left all, and went up to feede themſelves there, <hi>by the tents of the Shepherds.</hi> This is another part of our purchaſe of Chriſt (which God forbid it ſhould be our caſe) but if it ſhould come to that paſſe, rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the ordinances of God, which were of his owne ſetting and planting, as were the Miniſtery in the Synagogues; and they were to be divided all the Kingdome over; and the <hi>Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and we ſhould ſeeke the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117852:16"/>law at his mouth, Mal.</hi> 2.7.8. and therefore that being an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinance of God, they would by no meanes part with the free paſſage of any one of Gods ordinances, which ſometimes they did enjoy: but when they could not enjoy them in the purity thereof, but muſt be caſt off from <hi>being Preiſts,</hi> unleſſe they will do all, then they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be caſt out from all fellowſhip with the church, and leave their eſtates and fore-go all, rather then enjoy the liberty of ſome other with ſinfull defilement. And though it might be thought their own, over much, over readineſs to caſt off themſelves, yet notwithſtanding the holy Ghoſt excuſeth it, they did not caſt off themſelves, but the text ſaith, <hi>Ieroboham</hi> caſt them out, if they wil not miniſter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch termes, then it is he that caſts them out, and that was the ſin chiefly, whereby <hi>he made Iſrael to ſin;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you come to the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and though you finde Chriſt there, yet truſt not upon them unleſſe you truſt upon Chriſt, and ſeeke him to give you a meeting there; you have truſted but upon lying words, you went out full, and come empty home; you heare much, and profit little; and all that you learne you <hi>put into a broken bagge,</hi> into crackt memories, and all becauſe you did ſo truſt upon the meanes; and truly in this caſe this ſhall you often finde to be true, you come full of hopefull expectation to the Congregation, but returne very empty home, or full of bitterneſſe in your ſoules, and all was, becauſe you <hi>truſted in lying words,</hi> in words that <hi>could not profit;</hi> you truſted in the parts of Chriſtians, in the Sacraments, Word, and Prayer; but <hi>what is</hi> Paul, <hi>and what is</hi> Apollo, one of them <hi>may plant,</hi> another <hi>may water,</hi> but neither of both <hi>can give the increaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>He that plants, and he that waters is nothing;</hi> therefore chiefly have reſpect to Chriſt, look not at <hi>Paul,</hi> nor at <hi>Apollo,</hi> nor at any, though you had men equall with them for gifts, had you ſuch, yet if you put truſt and confidence in them, you wil looſe all the bleſſings that you deſire and hope to finde in them; and therefore ſo come to the Ordinances, as that you truſt not in the meanes; pray to Chriſt, to bleſſe the Ordinances to you, and intreat him
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117852:16"/>to cleanſe your hearts and hands from thoſe evils that are in his ſight, and come truſting on him, not on any ſtrength in the meanes, but on his bleſſing upon the meanes, and then he will be found of you, if you thus <hi>ſeeke him in truth;</hi> but if they cannot bee had but with danger to you, to loſe the peace of your conſciences,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> then be content to fit looſe to the Word and Sacraments, and from Chriſtian commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: Then in this caſe give this price alſo for Chriſt, for we come not to the Ordinances for the Ordinances ſake, but for Chriſt ſake to finde him there, but rather then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly put forth our hands to any ſinne rather looſe the Ordinances then looſe Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there is yet ſomething more then all this, a further price to pay, if we mean to purchaſe Chriſt; And that is, that we part with all our good parts, and all the good common gifts of grace, which are found ſometimes in good nature, and ſometimes in the children of the Church, we muſt part with them all that we may win Chriſt 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be wiſe in this world, let him become a foole that he may be wiſe:</hi> who ever would be a wiſe man, (as a wiſe man he cannot be, if hee have not his part in Chriſt) he muſt lay aſide his ſerious and ſad deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and communication with fleſh and blood, and all things in the way of God, that he thinkes will be prejudiciall, if any man be ſo wiſe, as to ſee this and that danger in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe, let him become a foole; elſe he ſhall never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Chriſtian: if a man will be content to forſake all for Chriſt, he muſt firſt be a foole, and be content to bee counted a foole, and heare every carnall man to count him a foole. And I ſpeak not onely of carnal and civill wiſdom, that, that only is to be denyed in this caſe, but common graces, which many times choakes all the hypocrites in the boſome of the Church; they are commonly choaked upon this point, upon theſe things they truſt, and doe therefore verily beleeve, that this and that intereſt, God hath in them, and they in God; becauſe they have received ſuch and ſuch gifts from him, and this is the caſe formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23. they pleaded their ſpirituall gifts,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117852:17"/>though common gifts, and ſuch as may be found in <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> they <hi>prayed to God,</hi> a common gift; and they <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in his name,</hi> they had prophetical gifts; ſome meaſure of the ſpirit of miniſtery, and they were able <hi>to caſt out devills in Chriſts name;</hi> now when as men do truſt upon theſe, and ſettle themſelves upon ſuch a change, truly, hereby they looſe that power in Chriſt which elſe they might have had. Its a wonder to ſee what a change propheticall gifts will work in a man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.10, 12. he, there <hi>Saul</hi> had a ſpirit of propheſie came upon him, and the people wondred at it, it works a ſtrange change in a man, and ſo in the next chap. the 19 and 23 ver. he propheſied til he came at ſuch a place, ſo that you ſhall ſee a man that is trained up in any good order, though ſometimes given to looſe company; when once God begins to poure into him any ſpirituall gift, to inlighten his mind, and to inlarge his affection, that hee begins to have ſome love to, and ſome joy in the Word, and ſome ſorrow in hearing of the Word, and ſome comfort in meditation: Its wonder to ſee what a change this will work in the ſpirit; he forthwith begins to abandon his looſe courſes, and ſets himſelfe to a more ſtrict courſe, then hee begins to ſee his acquiſite learning is but a ſmall matter to edification; hee prizes his ſpirituall gifts, and hee is able now to doe much; and when a mans heart is thus changed by propheticall gifts, it workes in a man ſuch confidence in his ſoule, that he thinkes all the Congregation ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh before he can periſh, and if Miniſters, may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by common gifts and graces, how much more may their poor hearers bee deceived, when they by hearing the Word find ſuch comfort, and illumination, and inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they thereby finde a great change wrought in them; and yet if miniſters may bee ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in preſuming vainly of their good eſtate, which was not ſo, then much more common Chriſtians: Should any man preſume at <hi>Foelix his trembling, Act.</hi> 24.25. <hi>At Jehues zeale,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.16. <hi>At Ahabs humiliation,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.28, 29. <hi>At Herods joy</hi> in hearing, you know what became of all these, thoſe be graces of God, though but common graces,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117852:17"/>and if the Prophets were deceived, may not theſe be deceived alſo, that have neither Chriſt nor any part in him; and therefore a man that would bee ſure not to goe without Chriſt, nor without life in him; he muſt not truſt in any ſpirituall gift he hath received, though his mind be enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, ſometimes to feare, ſometimes to joy, to humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to inlargement, to zealous reformation, yet reſt in none of theſe, for theſe you may have and yet want Chriſt, and life in him; common graces may and will deceive you, a man may have all theſe, and yet not prize Chriſt, at his cheifeſt good; he may have all theſe, and yet not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him: Notwithſtanding all theſe, there may bee ſome iniquity in their hands for which cauſe God will not ſhew mercy to them: See and obſerve, if in the midſt of all theſe you do not <hi>worke ſome iniquity;</hi> they were <hi>workers of iniquity</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at the beſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. you may be workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, notwithſtanding all theſe; and therefore conſider if there be not ſome veine of pride, and hypocriſie, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, that cleaves faſt to your hearts, which you allow your ſelves in, which if you doe, theſe very gifts will bee your ſhip-wracke, your anchor will breake, and your ſhip will bee carryed away, and you fall downe in deſtruction; but ſee that your hearts bee cleane, and ſee that there bee not an ill thought or way that you allow your ſelves in, and if ſo, then your heart will lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and you will prize Chriſt, and then it is a ſigne thoſe gifts you have are not in hypocriſie; for in an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, they are alwayes found with ſome ſinne, which if a man doe not willfully ſhut his eyes againſt hee may ſee, for our Saviour ſpeakes of ſuch a ſinne in them, as the reſt of the people of God may know them to be counterfeits, from verſe 15 to 23. <hi>You ſhall know them by this, doe men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grapes of thornes, or figges of thiſtles?</hi> have not they their ill haunts, but put away theſe from you, if you mean to have Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If we would have Chriſt, and life in him, we may have him in Juſtification, but not in growth of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, if you part not with confidence in the ſaving
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117852:18"/>graces of Gods Spirit, you muſt not looke to be juſtified by them, for if you doe you wil diſcover them not to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified graces, nor the fruits of them, the fruits of ſaving grace; <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing, if you looke to be ſaved by the righteouſneſſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 5.3, 4. If therefore we thinke that for theſe graces ſake God accepts us, truly we looſe the things that we have wrought, and for all that we have received, we have no part nor portion in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, neither <hi>Abraham</hi> nor <hi>David</hi> hath <hi>whereon to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> Rom 4.4.18. <hi>But bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no ſinne, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</hi> Therein ſtands our bleſſedneſſe, when the Lord imputes not ſinne to us, but if we looke to be juſtified either by the gifts of grace we have received, or by the workes and acts of grace that we have performed, we ſhall certainly fall ſhort; <hi>Paul</hi> knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein he had dealt unfaithfully, and yet was he not thereby juſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>but he that juſtifies me is the Lord;</hi> and therefore if you truſt upon a gift, and thereby to be juſtified and accepted, you declare your graces to be but common, and ſuch as are but found among Hypocrites, and in this, the Papiſts have cauſe to groane under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that lyes upon their religion, they by looking for ſalvation, and acceptance by common graces, doe plainly ſhew, that Chriſt profits them nothing.</p>
            <p>And further, as you are not to truſt upon them for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſo neither are you to truſt upon them for the life of your ſanctification, for though they be truly parts of ſanctification, faith, hope, love, patience, humility, and every other grace of God which flowes from our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the death of Chriſt, becauſe theſe are parts of our ſanctification, you may looke at them as precious tallents received from God, yet if you truſt in theſe, in preaching, or praying, or edefying your ſelves, or families, or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and that in the ſtrength of theſe you <hi>ſhall doe vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and bring mighty things to paſſe,</hi> and be a fruitfull Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, you have truth of grace, ſound hearted ſaving grace, and you doubt not but God will carry you an end in a comfortable Chriſtian courſe; if ſo, you wil finde this to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117852:18"/>true, that you wil want Chriſt in the quickning and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and thriving power of the life of your ſanctification, it cannot be but that where ſaving grace is, there is Chriſt; but you may have Chriſt and yet have but a dead Chriſt of him, he may be ſo dead in your ſpirit, that you ſhall cry out, O what a dead heart, and a dead ſpirit have I, and yet I doubt not but Chriſt is in my heart; true, it may be thou haſt received him, but Chriſt can tell how to lye dead, and to worke but little there where ſaving grace is layed up; and therefore <hi>the life of Chriſt is not a life of grace, but a life of faith.</hi> I live not by all my zeale and humility, and gifts of grace, for I might have all theſe, and make but dead work of them all; How then? <hi>By the faith of the Sonne of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. It is one of the chiefeſt points that concernes our Chriſtian practiſe, and therefore I pray you conſider it;<note place="margin">Note this.</note> the life of Chriſtianity is not a life of wiſdome and graces, but of faith: if you would have Chriſt live in you, and live ſo that he may ſhew his life in you, you muſt then live by faith; that is, not only looke for your juſtification by faith in Chriſt, but looke for your ſanctification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from Chriſt by faith, that if you goe about any duty, goe not about it in the ſtrength of grace received, preach not, or pray not in the ſtrength of your knowledge, and love, and zeale, and humility, but go about them all in faith in Jeſus Chriſt, that is by comming to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly ſenſible, that unleſſe he put new life into us, and make new worke in our ſoules, we may have but a dead buſineſſe of it, all the graces of Gods Spirit in us but dead; and herein it is wonder to ſee ſometimes, how Gods ſervants are ſtraitned, all for want of the life of faith in their ſoules; if God cut ſhort with us, it is becauſe we doe not live in Chriſt, but in the ſpirit of grace, and think to walke by the ſtrength of grace received, we looſe by it, and ſpend of the ſtock of grace; and therefore remember that ſpeech, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40.30, 31. <hi>They that waite on the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength,</hi> to ſhew you your duty; it is a borrowed ſpeech from young men going out to warre, they goe out in the name of the Lord of Hoſts, as <hi>David</hi> went out againſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117852:19"/>
               <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. If we waite upon the Lord, and be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our owne Inſufficiency, and unworthineſſe of doing any Chriſtian duty, and not depend upon our owne ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, then we ſhall finde God lifting us up farre beyond all our owne apprehenſions; and gifts: God wil put a new life into us, and in this caſe even the weakeſt gifts of Gods ſervants are ſometimes much enlarged, and the ſame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians gifts farre more enlarged at ſome time, above what they are at another, only by waiting upon the Lord, and that puts life into our duties; therefore if you would finde Chriſt to be the life of your ſanctification, then you muſt put away all confidence in ſaving graces, they are not able to make you bring forth any one lively fruit of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, I mean in your owne eſtimation; and you wil have little comfort in it. There is in this caſe much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between one Chriſtian and another, and between the ſame Chriſtian and himſelfe, at one time and another, according to his waiting on the Lord for the renewall of his ſtrength, therefore truſt not in any grace, if you doe, you wil want it when you ſtand in moſt need of it.</p>

Any of us that have made a Covenant with God by Sacrifice; no man hath him unleſſe by way of covenant, for all theſe wayes, though divers in explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet all co-incident to this having of Chriſt. And ſuch as have made a covenant with God by Sacrifice, they are his people; of them it is ſaid, <hi>I am thy God,</hi> verſ. 7. according to the tenour of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Behold, I make a Covenant with thee this day, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed.</hi> God becomes a God to me, and to my ſeed by way of covenant; ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10. to 13. both your Children of underſtanding, and your little ones of no underſtanding, you are all here before God this day, to enter into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, to keep his Commandements for ever; you and yours enter into a Covenant with God, and this is the way of having him for our God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17.18 <hi>This day thou haſt avouched the Lord to be thy God, and he hath avouched thee to be his people; Junius</hi> tranſlates the word. <hi>Thou haſt required by way of Covenant, and he hath promiſed that he will be thy God:</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:117852:20"/>in the originall it is, <hi>he hath made thee to ſpeake, thou haſt made God to ſpeake this,</hi> as men that make promiſes one to another, ſo that when people give up themſelves to be the Lords, and offer themſelves up to him, and when God requires it of us, we yeeld our ſelves to him, and deſire God to be a God to us, then he is our God, and we are his people by way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They gave themſelves firſt to the Lord, and then unto us by the will of God,</hi> when we have beſtowed our ſelves upon God, he is not wanting to receive us, to bee his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Now for further opening of this, It was ſaid this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made with God by way of ſacrifice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5.7. that was according to the ſacrifice which the people of God did ſolemnly offer before God, of which you read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.3. to the end of the eighth ver. <hi>Moſes</hi> told the people the words of the Lord, and the people anſwered with one voyce and ſaid, <hi>All the words which the Lord hath ſaid, wee will heare it, and doe it;</hi> They promiſe themſelves to be an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient people to God, what ever he commands them, that will they hear, and that will they do.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, <hi>Moſes</hi> tooke the blood of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſprinkled it upon the people, and by this meanes they did paſſe into Covenant with God. It implyes thus much, when we come to make a Covenant with God, we profeſſe our ſelves as guilty of death, and therefore look up to Chriſt, deſiring that his death might be imputed to us, and we thereupon offer our ſelves, ſoules and bodies to bee obedient to God to the death; onely we require this back againe of God, that as we give up our ſelves a ſacrifice to him, ſo that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt might be imputed unto us; and the blood of Chriſt, and the life of Chriſt might be communicated to us; his life of righteouſneſſe, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of eternal glory, all that life that is in Chriſt might become ours, this doth God require of them, and this is to make a Covenant with God by way of ſacrifice; for the Burnt-offering, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. was a Type of Chriſt, the Meat-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was a Type of the peoples giving up themſelves to God, and this is to make a Covenant by ſacrifice: we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117852:20"/>we deſerve death, but for time to come, we deſire to give up our ſelves, to do and ſuffer his will, onely we deſire that the blood of Chriſt might be ſprinkled upon our ſouls, and that we might live in his ſight.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe that have thus made a Covenant with God, hee calls them his people, and Saints. Thus you ſee what it is, and wherein this Covenant ſtands, ſometimes ſome branch of this is expreſſed in other Covenants: God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he will be a God to him; that is, he will not only be a good Father to him, nor only a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or Tutour, nor only a good King, nor a good Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; but what ſoever is good, that is in God, and it is but a drop, but a ſparke of the well-ſpring of life in him, all the goodneſſe that is diſperſed in the creature, flowes from him; there is goodneſſe in a good Father, or Magiſtrate, or Miniſter, or Friend, but when God undertakes to bee a God to us, he promiſes to be to us whatſoever is good in the creature; a good Father, a good Friend, a good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, whatever is good for ſoule and body, he will bee all in all to us, and that partly in his owne perſon, and partly, in ſo ordering matters,<note place="margin">Extent of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on Gods part</note> that all thoſe things wherein his goodneſſe is communicated, he will ſo diſpoſe them, that we ſhall ſee a goodneſſe of God in them all; we ſhall ſee the preſence and goodneſſe of God in all the bleſſings we partake in this world, he will be whatſoever is needfull for us in every kind, and though any meanes should faile, yet God will not faile us: this do we deſire of God,<note place="margin">God a fountain of goodnes to his.</note> when we deſire him to be our God, God is an heape and fountaine of goodneſſe, and he undertakes ſo to be us.</p>
            <p>Now as wee expect this from God, that he would be a God to us, ſo we deſire alſo and offer our ſelves back again to God, to be obedient to his will, and to waite upon him for all that which he hath promiſed us, to expect it, and to waite for it; And when we undertake to be obedient to him; not that we promiſe it in our owne names, and for our owne parts, but in the behalfe of every ſoule that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us, as wee deſire a bleſſing upon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us, ſo we offer up our ſelves to God, and our wives,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117852:21"/>and children,<note place="margin">Extent of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on our part.</note> and ſervants, and kindred, and acquaintance, and all that are under our reach, either by way of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or co-ordination, ſo farre as in our power we may reach, either by Commandement or counſell, we do as much as in us lyes promiſe to God, that we and our houſholds wil ſerve the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>hee and his houſhold,</hi> that is, his children and ſervants, and all that are bought with mony, they will all ſerve the Lord, this they offer to God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a family; he and his, ſo much as he is able, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with them, to keep Gods Commandements, and God will be a God to them all; a Father, and Maſter, a Magiſtrate and Miniſter, Husband, Friend, and Phiſitian and all, and whatſoever is good, thus you ſee how God comes to be ours by way of Covenant.</p>
            <p>For further clearing of this poynt there is a three-fold Covenant,<note place="margin">Covenant three fold</note> wherein God doth bind himſelfe to his people, and we back again to him, according as there is among the reaſonable creatures.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt is, Between Prince and People, ſo the high Prieſt made a Covenant, between him, and between all the people, and between the King, that they ſhould be the Lords people, and ſuch a Covenant there is uſually in all well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Common-wealths, unleſſe the King comes in by way of Conqueſt and Tyranny, but in well ſettled Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, there is a Covenant and Oath between Prince and People.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is a Covenant between Man and Wife, of which it is ſaid <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Which forſaketh the Guide of her Youth, and forgetteth the Covenant of her God.</hi> Theſe are all called the Covenant of God, he is a party in the Covenant ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Another, is an Oath or a Covenant of God to paſſe betweene Friend, and Friend; ſuch was the Covenant between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.16.</p>
            <p>Now there is a certain Covenant between God and his people in al theſe; that look what a King requires of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or the people of a King, the very ſame doth God require of his people, and the people of God, that offers himſelf to be a God to his people; that is, a Governor, a Provider for,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117852:21"/>and a protector of his people, to fight their Battels for them, and to guide and rule them in peace and juſtice; and the people undertake to be obedient to his Lawes, to whatever he declares to be the counſell of his will.</p>
            <p>Againe, there is a Covenant of Marriage between God and his people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.14. ſo as the Wife promiſes to be to her Husband alone, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3, 4. ſo the Church of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, that ſhe wil be for God alone, and God wil be for us alone; and we embrace the ſeed of his Word and grace in our hearts, and bring forth fruit to God alone.</p>
            <p>And there is alſo a Covenant of Friendſhip between God and us, <hi>A covenant of Salt,</hi> 2 Chron. 13.5. A covenant of Salt is to be fed with the ſame ſalt, as it were, to eate many a buſhel of ſalt together, that is a covenant of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; <hi>Didſt not thou give the Land to the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>thy friend for ever?</hi> 2 Chron. 20.7.<note place="margin">Covenant of Salt.</note> therein he fitly expreſſeth the nature of a covenant of ſalt, by friendſhip for ever; ſalt eaten together expreſſes familiarity, and durableneſſe, now God expreſſeth himſelfe thus, to enter into a covenant with his people; he takes <hi>Abraham</hi> as a friend for ever, and <hi>Abraham</hi> takes God as his friend for ever; and this league of friendſhip implyes not only preſervation of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but it requires a kinde of ſecret communication one to another, and a doing one for another. God he grants our Petitions for us as a friend, and we doe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements as a friend out of the integrity of our hearts; <hi>John</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my friends if ye doe whatſoever I command you; I know that</hi> Abraham <hi>will command his houſhold to feare mee,</hi> Gen. 18.19. and therefore in verſ. 17. and 18. he ſaith, <hi>How ſhall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing that I am about to doe?</hi> and it was concerning a ſecret counſell of God, now when God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to be our friend, he undertakes to communicate ſundry of his Counſels to us, his <hi>ſecrets are to them that feare him,</hi> Pſal. 25.14. Many ſecret paſſages ſhall their hearts be made privie to, that others ſhall never be acquainted with; he wil acquaint us with his ſecret purpoſe about a people, ſometimes in Prayer, ſometimes in Humiliation, ſometimes one way, and ſometimes another, ſo as you may ſee he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117852:22"/>walkes towards us in a covenant of friendſhip; and ſo he wil play a friends part, he wil counſell us for the beſt, he wil tell us, this, and that, is the beſt courſe for us to take, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12. <hi>Him ſhall he teach:</hi> He wil come and tell us what he would have us to doe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.8. Sometimes by his Word, and ſometimes by his Providence; and when wee looke up to him as to a friend, he wil doe a friends part: And on the other ſide, for our part we ſhall never take any buſineſſe in hand, but we ſhall ſadly and ſeriouſly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate all our affairs with God, and think our ſelves bound to doe it, not dare to ruſh upon any thing but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation firſt with the Lord, and acquainting him with ſuch and ſuch things; <hi>We know not what to doe, but our eyes are unto thee,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.12. So we offer up our ſelves to be ready at his commandement, to doe whatſoever he ſhall counſell us to doe; let him but make our way plaine before us, and we wil heare him in whatſoever he requires of us, be it what it wil be, if God lay it before us, we wil doe it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. verſ. 1. of the fifth Part. <hi>Teach me thy ſtatutes, and</hi> I <hi>will keep it even to the end.</hi> Obſerve then, whether we have Chriſt for our Chriſt by way of covenant, did there ever paſſe ſuch a conveyance between Chriſt and you, to God the Father, about him and your ſoules, that if God ſhould looke upon you, and conſider your caſe, your juſt and due deſert is everlaſting deſtruction; and therefore you account your ſelves unworthy of an mercy from God, but yet notwithſtanding if he wil be but pleaſed to accept the death of Chriſt for you, and to be-ſprinkle you with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of his grace, you wil give up your ſelves to an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervice of him all your dayes, and wil be ready to doe his wil, and that he ſhall be to you as a King, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Have you ever paſſed over to him your preſervation, and protection, and proviſion? And looke what affection is between Husband and Wife, hath there been the like affection in your ſoules towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Have you a ſtrong and hearty deſire to meet him in the bed of loves, when ever you come to the Congregation, and deſire you to have the ſeeds of his grace ſhed abroad in your
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117852:22"/>hearts, and bring forth the fruits of grace to him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that you may be for him, and for none other, and you deſire to acquaint him with all your counſels and ſecrets, and deſire to doe nothing but as he ſhall counſell and direct you? And have you therefore been willing to give up your ſelves, you and yours to be ruled by Chriſt; and is it the griefe of your ſoules if any of your Children, and Servants ſhall not ſtoop to God, and if you uſe the beſt meanes to draw them on to goodneſſe? truly then you have Chriſt for your Chriſt, becauſe you have him by way of covenant: When God gives us hearts thus to agree with him, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies prevents us, he is ever before us, then Chriſt thou haſt, and in him thou haſt life; but if on the contrary, we never come before God in acknowledgement that death was our portion, and deſired the bloud of Chriſt to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to us, not in an overture of ſpeech, but when it comes to the point, what wil you doe? Wil you accept him as your friend, and as your Husband, and wil you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all good things from him, and you wil not dare to venture upon any courſe or way further then the light and ſinceritie of the Word gives liberty? And if you never came to this, nor was it ever your care whether your Houſhold ſerved God or no, though they ſin againſt God, and ſweare and lye, yet all this is nothing to you, but it is all one with you, then there wants a covenant betweene God and you, and then if you have him not by covenant, you have him not at all; he that hath him any way, hath him every way, though it be not ſo clearly ſeene every way; if you have him, then you have friends and enemies in common; if it be not ſo with you, that you obſerve not the counſels of God, but you wil be at a looſe end, and doe what you thinke good in your owne eyes, then there is no covenant between God and you, and then you have not Chriſt, and then no life, much leſſe in abundance.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But you ſay, Who is there that ſo lookes to himſelfe, his Wife, and Children, and Servants, ſo to his owne heart and others, as that they are ſo wholly conformable to Gods will in all that he counſels and commands, and who ſo expects ſuch bleſſings, but that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117852:23"/>they take from God many things in ill part, and oft times ſit down mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and diſcontent.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Even they that make a Covenant with God, they often breake Covenant with him; and ſo often as you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine any thought in your mind, wherein you have not conſulted with God, and doe any thing further then you have warrant from God, ſo often have you broken Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſo often as there is any paſſage in our lives, for which wee had not warrant from the mouth of God, and wrought it by the ſtrength of his grace, and eye of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſo far have we broke Covenant with him; but yet notwithſtanding this breach of Covenant, here ſtands their helpe, and this is their comfort, that God hath given Chriſt <hi>for a Covenant, Eſa.</hi> 49.8. ſo that he will make good our breach of Covenant on his owne part, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. he becomes a <hi>Surety</hi> for our parts, God needs no Surety for his part, but wee need one; ſo that if wee have Chriſt for our Surety, then this is required of us, that knowing we have broken Covenant with God, we ought to bluſh, and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of it, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. to 12. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.5. to 20. they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe they have broken Covenant with God, and thereupon they ſit down bluſhing, and weeping, and rending their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they ſhould enter into such a ſolemne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and hope to receive ſo many mercies from him, and yet ſo unfaithfully to breake Covenant with him, when we ſee that we have tranſgreſſed and forgotten the Covenant of God, and breake the counſells of God, we or ours: It is for us in ſuch a caſe to do as thoſe people did in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who broke Covenant with God; to go and bluſh before him, that we ſhould deale ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily with that God, that hath made ſuch a perpetuall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of faith with us, that will be all that is good to us, and hath not been wanting to doe all for us: and we not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, who undertooke, ſolemnly that we and our children, and ſervants ſhould walke after God, and wee would teach them to doe what is good in Gods ſight, and yet we do not take care that they do ſo; and for other of our friends, whom we might be helpefull to, we wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117852:23"/>them; we ought to ſhame our ſelves for this breach of Covenant, elſe we cannot ſay, that wee make a true Covenant with God, &amp; charge our ſelves for being ſo falſe unto God, and then ſome good may come of it. When the people had broken Covenant with God, and God was very angry, and would have no more to do with them, <hi>Exo.</hi> 32. But ch. 33. the people put off their beſt cloathes and came before him, and humbled themſelves in his preſence, and put off their beſt cloathes, and intreated God to bee reconciled unto them, and then he againe renewes his Covenant with them. To ſhew you how God is wont to expreſſe himſelfe to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when we have broken Covenant with him, God will ſay, he will not look at us any more, he wil never protect us more, he will neither meddle nor make with us, but will expoſe us to all evill; now if hereupon we returne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile our breach of Covenant with God, how little good we have done, and how little ſerviceable we are, he is then wont to let us ſee, that his Covenant was never ſo far bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but he can tell how to be good to us, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake, And this is a third way of having of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A Fourth way, is a way of free acceptance, wee have Chriſt by receiving him, that is the laſt way,<note place="margin">Fourthway of having of Chriſt.</note> whereby Chriſt is ſaid to be conveyed to us, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>to as many as received him, to them he gave power to be called the ſons of God,</hi> that is the life of a Chriſtian to become a Sonne of God, and God is the Father not of the dead but of the living, ſo that here is a receiving of Chriſt by faith, whereby we become the ſonnes of God, ſo that if you would know, whether you have Chriſt or no, whether or no do you receive him? Receive him by faith, and that goes through all the former, but ſome thing different. Amongſt Interpreters this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt is many wayes taken: Some ſay it is to receive him as a King and a Savior, and it is not in vain, but under correction: It doth not fitly interpret the notion of the Word; But the ſubſtance of the thing delivered by the Holy Ghoſt, if I doe not miſtake it, the phraſe expreſſeth thus much; As many as receive him into their hearts as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117852:24"/>a Houſe or Temple, and it will hold according to the compariſon uſed by the holy ghoſt; <hi>he came unto his own,</hi> into the Temple, or Houſe of God, and thither he came as into his owne proper place, he came unto his owne; you are to conceive, he ſpeakes not only of Chriſts comming among them in the tabernacle of fleſh and bloud, for of that in verſ. 1. but the whole Chapter is an Hiſtory, and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, partly before the world was; and in their giving light to all in the Creation, and after the fall, when the world was growne darke, then he was the <hi>true light, that enlightened every one that was in the world;</hi> now he was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world knew him not. And he came to his owne people in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and they apprehended him not; but as many as received him of old, to them he gave power to be called the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>But for further opening of this Phraſe, read <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.27. <hi>He tooke her home to his owne houſe;</hi> it is in the originall the ſame word with that in <hi>John,</hi> 1.11. in <hi>to his owne home;</hi> he came unto his owne home or houſe, unto his owne Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and people, and they received him not, but neglected his Ordinances, neglected to ſeeke Chriſt in the Temple; but as many as did there ſeeke him, and looke toward him, he gave them power to be called the ſonnes of God; ſo that to receive Chriſt according to the meaning of this place, is, to receive him into our hearts as into his proper houſe; and he comes there as a Maſter, and theſe receive him as into a Temple, then we have him by receiving him into an houſe or home; now you are <hi>the Temples of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>I will dwell in you,</hi> and you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as into a temple three waies.</note> Now, how doe we receive Chriſt into our hearts as into a Temple? There be three things by which we receive Chriſt as into a Temple:</p>
            <p>Firſt, when we doe prepare a way for Chriſt to come in to us, as it is ſaid of <hi>John,</hi> he prepared the way for Chriſt, that ſo he might ſuddenly come into his Temple, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame Meſſenger, he ſaith, <hi>Every
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117852:24"/>mountaine ſhall be brought low, and every valley filled up; crooked wayes be made ſtrait, and rough wayes made ſmooth,</hi> Iſa. 40.3, 4. and this is the preparation we muſt make for Chriſt to come into us; you have ſometime heard this fully ſpoken to; that is, when the high mountaines of our great ſpirits, and lofty lookes, are brought ſo low, that we are content to be nothing in our owne eyes, that we have all we have in Chriſt, and are able to bring nothing to him, and are willing that he ſhould take all from us, whatever he would have us to part with; and when we are willing to be what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he would have us to be, and that he ſhould doe with us what is good in his owne eyes; then theſe high mountaines being brought low, we are made fit for Chriſt to come into us, we muſt have no crooked wayes of our owne; if we have any imagination of our owne left in us, that we wil part with ſuch and ſuch Luſts, but yet are loath to be diſpoſed of in all things as God wil have us, then there is no roome for God, he wil not climbe for it; but if we ſmooth the way for him, then he wil come into our hearts.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, there is to be filled up every low valley, and that holds forth two things; Every Valley ſhal be filled, that is, firſt, every baſe heart ſhall lift up it ſelfe to the high things of God, for he ſpeakes of vallies firſt, as if there were ſuch a low dejectedneſſe in the Creature, as made it unfit for Chriſt; God requires that every baſe heart ſhould be exalted, to the minding of high and heavenly things, lifted up farre above theſe low things that cannot reach the wayes of God, theſe Gates muſt ſtand open, and be lifted up, <hi>that the King of glory may come in,</hi> Pſal. 24.7. to 10. and he meanes the gates of our hearts, and he calls them, the gates of eternity, they are our hearts and ſoules; ſtand not poring upon earthly things here below, but lift up your heads higher, looke for a God, and for a Kingdome; ſtand not pedling about theſe earthly things, as if you had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to looke after; your hearts lye too low for Chriſt to come into, but if you would lye levell with him, then lift up your minde to heavenly things; let the bent of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117852:25"/>your heart be for pardon of ſinne, and for everlaſting life, be of a levell frame of ſpirit to the Kingdome of Heaven, and then Chriſt will come into you.</p>
            <p>And as it implyes, that the heart muſt not be too low for Chriſt through baſeneſſe of ſpirit, and an earthly mind, ſo it may be too low through deſpaire, and through exceſſive ſorrow for ſinne, he may be caſt ſo low downe in dejection of ſpirit, that his heart lyes too low for Chriſt, not able to lay hold on Gods favour to him in Chriſt; thinkes the Promiſes belongs not to him, it is well and happy for them that can lay hold upon them, but for his part there is none of theſe Promiſes reach him; Did yee ever know any in my caſe finde mercy? now the heart lyes ſomething too low, this mans heart is not baſe, he looks at Chriſt as the moſt honourable thing in the world, he ſets his heart upon the bloud of Chriſt, and would be glad with all his heart that he had his part in it, but he is dejected, and lyes too low, fit to deſpaire, and therefore in this caſe a Chriſtian muſt be thus farre exalted, as to be made levell with Chriſt, to beleeve there is hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> touching his eſtate; Chriſt hath had mercy upon many in ſuch a caſe, and he wil doe ſo to us, if we ſeeke him in the way of his Ordinances, and if therefore we reſolve to ſeek him, and put our mouthes in the duſt, expecting ſalvation to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by him, and follow him in his Ordinances, and never have fellowſhip with the unfruitfull workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and wil ſtill continue to ſeeke him, then we begin to be ſomething levell with Chriſt; But you ſay, There is ſuch a crookedneſſe in my heart, and un-evenneſſe, that Chriſt cannot come in; truly that muſt be made ſtrait. Princes are not wont to goe downe back lanes, but downe plaine wayes; ſo Chriſt, as he would have his way neither too high, nor too low, ſo he would not goe round about, but would have the way to lye plaine before him; the judgement, and heart, and affection, lye in ſuch ſort of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as ſimply to aime at the glory of God in his way, and therein to be ruled by the Word of God, and then is the heart of a man in a good frame; if there be nothing in a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117852:25"/>mans heart, but hee is willing to bee guided in it, by the ſtreight rule of Gods Word, and hee aimes directly at the glory of God, and the comming of his Kingdom, and the doing of his will, then is all a mans crooked wayes laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and the heart lyes ſo levell, that Chriſt will ſuddenly come into his Temple, theſe crooked windings of a ſpirit of hypocriſie are made ſtreight, when he is brought low, yet he may have much hypocriſie in him, pretend to be more then he is, he may be doing good dutys more to be ſeen of men, then that God ſhould obſerve him; therefore when God hath brought us to this, that we are deſirous of grace, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in truth then in outward ſhew, or if in ſhew, but that we might doe others good thereby, and ſingly aime at Gods glory in it, and deſire and endeavor to walk by the ſtreight rule of the Word of God, then are our hearts cleanſed in ſome meaſure, from the crooked windings of hypocriſie, which might hinder the free paſſage of Chriſt into the ſoul.</p>
            <p>And yet there is another winding in a mans heart, though in ſome truth the dutyes be done, yet there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times an aptneſſe in us to cover and to wind about our own ſinnes, and to make them leſſe then they be, and this is a wicked courſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.4, 5. and therefore God would have us deale moſt plainly with him, that in the ſingleneſſe of our hearts, when it may ſtand with the glory of God, and the confuſion of our own faces, we will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lay open our hearts before him, theſe be ſuch win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings as will not profit us, when we deal plainly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe what we have done, and come to be thus open hearted to God, then is Chriſt ready to come ſuddenly into his Temple, when we have brought downe our high ſpirits, and raiſed up our too low, baſe and dejected ſpirit; and laid all levell before him, then there remaines no more, but for Chriſt to come ſuddainly into his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>But yet beſides all this, when al this is don, yet there may be ſtil a great meaſure of a rough, and harſh, and ſharpe, and fiery ſpirit in him, which Chriſt will have removed before he comes to dwel there, before that, he will have this harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117852:26"/>and bitterneſſe laid down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they ſhal be ſmooth and level before him, the frame of the heart ſhall be as meeke as a Lamb: The Lamb of God will not lye in a den of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and if we breake out into harſh and unſavory diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers afterward, we ſhal damp the life of God in us, the life of Chriſt wil be dead in us: and therefore if you deſire to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chriſt into your hearts; then lay aſide al harſhneſſe, and bitterneſſe, and roughneſſe, and al guile of crookedneſſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. then you ſhal have life in the Word, and find Chriſt to be yours. This is the firſt thing whereby we receive Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Second way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt.</note>Secondly, Suppoſe he be come, there is thus much more required to have him, and to keep him there, we muſt look there be no unholy thing remaining there, all vaine and common things muſt be removed, no prophain matter muſt ſtay there, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>touch no unclean thing.</hi> And if Chriſt be come unto you, you muſt not onely remove all ſinfull and uncleane matter, but alſo all common matter, and now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing muſt be dedicated to God, and you muſt goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your callings as becomes Chriſtians, and you and all yours muſt be dedicated to God; your ſilver and your gold muſt be dedicated, and onely ſpent upon ſuch uſes, as God calls for, and therefore look at every thing ſo, as God may have glory by it, and let him not bee diſhonoured in any thing by you, all that you are, and have, muſt be dedicated to God; mind, and judgement, and conſcience, and heart, and affection, love and hatred; your whole man, and all your labours, and all you can reach, lyes as a conſecrated thing, elſe God will not dwell livelily in you, unleſſe you have a care to keepe every thing cleane, you ſhall find this to be true, <hi>Chriſt loves to lye cleane, and Religion loves to lye cleane,</hi> and if hee ſee haſty ſluttiſhneſſe in us, he will be gone and wil not tarry there, he would not have naturall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes to appear among you, but let al ſuch be covered, and let no ſuch defilement be ſeen among you, he would have all kept in an holy reverent frame, ſuch as might become the preſence of God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third way.</note>Thirdly, The receiving of Chriſt into our hearts as into a Temple implyes to keep the charge of his Ordinances and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117852:26"/>holy things, to offer to him all our ſacrifices, and to look that all be performed in ſuch a manner as himſelf requireth, God chargeth it as a ſinne upon his people, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 44.8 <hi>ye have not kept the charge of my holy things,</hi> but ye have ſet kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of my Ordinances in my Sanctuary for your ſelves, God will not dwell among them, when they ſet up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed to offer up their Sacrifices, God will have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to take charge over his own Temple; have a care of your ſelves, put not off your care to others, you may not put off the charge of Gods holy things, every man hath a charge to look to the things of God; not only to ſee that al unclean things be removed, and all common things dedicated, but to ſee that every morning and evening, Sacrifice be duly performed, and all things done in a right manner, elſe you will finde little life in Chriſt, and if he ſee this care in you, then Chriſt will come into his Temple and dwell there, and you ſhall have life in Chriſt, and that in abundance, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have God for your God, but you muſt have a place, readily prepared for him, and keepe it in fitneſſe, and comelyneſſe for him, trimme it up for an habitation for him, this God requires of every ſoule that will have God for his God. In a word therefore, doe but conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your hearts have thus imbraced Chriſt or no; is your baſe hearts exalted to look after heavenly things,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> and are your proud hearts brought low to the obedience of Chriſt, do you find your ways of hypocriſie made plain before God, and is your rough paſſions made ſmooth before God, then you have Chriſt, whether you ſee him, or feel him or no; and do you find that when you have Chriſt, you dedicate your ſelves to him, and ſuffer no unclean thing in your ſelves or yours, and do you keep the Ordinances pure, and offer up your morning and evening ſacrifice your ſelves? then you have received Chriſt, and it is your faith by which you do thus receive him; but if it be not thus with you, then ſay you have not received Chriſt, or if you have, you are to be humbled for your great neglect, and want of keeping of him.</p>

            <p>The thing then to be opened is, <hi>What it is to have Chriſt, as the Son of the moſt high God,</hi> and that will give further light to the Text, and to the conſciences of them that would ſee the ground of their hopes ſettled upon a foundation, <hi>Hee that hath the Son hath life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There bee three things implyed in having Chriſt as a Sonne.</p>
            <p>Firſt it implyes, that ſuch as have Chriſt in truth, and ſo having him,<note place="margin">Firſt thing conſidered in having Chriſt as a Son.</note> have life by him; they do not reſt in having any of the benefits of Chriſt, though they be ſpirituall, but they cheifely affect to have himſelfe, not ſo much his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits as himſelfe; he doth not ſay, hee that hath ſuch and ſuch ſpirituall gifts hath the Son; no, though you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many gifts, and they ſuch as doe accompany ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117852:27"/>but that which he principally commends to us is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; you ſhall read of a company of Profeſſors that had Chriſt, and affected to have him ſo farre as they, might have Loaves from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.26, 27. but our bleſſed Saviour bids them in ſeeking Chriſt, ſeeke <hi>not for loaves that periſh, but labour for the meate which endureth to eternall life;</hi> and that is only the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf: Labor not for any loaves, whatſoever you might finde in your purſuit after Chriſt. It was this by which <hi>Peter</hi> did diſcover the hypocriſie of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he deſired the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, but for Chriſt himſelfe, his heart was not ſet upon him, but he only deſired that in which lay moſt profit; for had it been in his power, that upon the laying on of his hands upon any, Tongues might have been given, and Sickneſſes healed, he might have grown mighty in the world by that trade, <hi>Act</hi> 8.18, 19. And <hi>Balaam</hi> he was ſomewhat more upright in his deſire then <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was, one would thinke that he had ſought after Chriſt, for he wiſhed not for any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thing in this world, only that he might have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable end, he would feather his neſt with Immortality, and inveſt himſelfe with the Robes of incorruption, and ſuch kinde of other glory, as the Saints in light doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, but it was no more his deſire then the other, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Chriſt for himſelfe, but only a bleſſed end, that he might be tranſlated into immortality and glory, and ſo might be kept from fellowſhip with thoſe Devils, and evil Spirits he had been acquainted with all his life long, that he might not have fellowſhip with them when he departed hence; but did not deſire Chriſt for himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever gift he had, as he had a notable ſpirit of Propheſie, as the Spirit then came upon him, ſpeaking of the marvellous bleſſings reſerved for Gods people, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he never ſought Chriſt in any of them, and therefore though he might have ſome glimpſe of the Viſion of God, yet of Chriſt he had none; whereas there is no true Chriſtian that doth moſt eſteeme the having of Chriſt, but doth not only ſeeke Chriſt without reſpect of Loaves, or Money, or of a quiet Conſcience in time of death, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117852:28"/>even in the very time of this life, when he ſeekes after the Ordinances of God in this life, there to live according to God, and to finde pardon of ſinne and peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſubduing of his luſts, and ſtrength of grace, and power of godlineſſe, yet even in ſeeking the very Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God (out of which theſe are not to be found) yet in ſeeking of theſe, he doth not ſo much ſeeke theſe, or any bleſſing they doe afford, as the finding Chriſt in them; the ſtory is notable, and famous in, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26, 27. When <hi>David</hi> fled from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Prieſts and Levites carried the <hi>Arke</hi> after him, and when <hi>David</hi> ſaw them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake him with the Arke of Gods preſence, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof ſtood the life of his life, the aſſurance of the pardon of his ſinne, the aſſurance and preſence of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſtrengthening of his ſpirit in grace, and ſubduing his luſts) yet ſaith he, <hi>Carry it back againe to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>if I ſhall finde favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſhew me both it and his habitation; but if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let him doe to me as ſeemeth good to him.</hi> He would not wrong himſelfe, nor doe the Church of God ſo much prejudice as to wrong God, and his Sacrifice, they were not to offer ſacrifice elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; nor could they finde any ſolemne preſence of God any where but there, there were they all to meet, and it was the place where God had put his name; and he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that, he could not have the Arke with him, but Gods Name ſhould be diſhonoured, and the Church of God would finde much prejudice with the loſſe of Gods Arke; and therefore rather then God ſhould be diſhonoured, and the people diſcouraged and prejudiced by the want of it, he would ſend it back againe, and is content to looſe outward bleſſings; his care was not ſo much about out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, his chiefeſt care was, if he might have had his wiſh, that he might all his time <hi>dwell in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 23.4. and oh that he might be but <hi>a doore-keeper in this houſe, rather then to reſt in the tabernacle of wickedneſſe;</hi> but yet when he could not have this great bleſſing, but with diſhonour to God, and prejudice to the Church of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117852:28"/>God, he rather layes downe the comfort that he might have from Gods Ordinances, and the help he might have from them, and thoſe helps were very great; as pardon of ſinne, and peace of conſcience, growth in grace, ſubduing of luſts, and eſtabliſhment of his heart in aſſurance of his election, and vocation; yet he is content to let them all goe that he might have what he hath without ſinne to himſelfe, and diſhonour to God, or wrong to the Church; and this is a notable ſign of a mans integrity and uprightneſſe of heart, he would not have any thing whereby God might have diſhonour; he would not have the Ordinances with the Churches loſſe, but rather ſit out, and ſhift for himſelfe as wel as he could, and would adventure the loſſe of them all rather then he wil ſtand to contend for them with the loſſe of Chriſt himſelfe: And this kinde of frame of ſpirit was in <hi>Moſes,</hi> he intreates God that he would not deſtroy the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, leaſt his name ſhould be diſhonoured, but rather blot his name out of the Booke of Life then cut them all off, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. Such is the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the frame of the heart of a Childe of God, that he deſires not Spirituall bleſſings ſingly for himſelfe, not for the peace of his owne Conſcience, nor for the ſubduing of his luſts, nor for the ſtrengthening of his grace, further then may ſtand with the glory of God; and above all things elſe he ſeekes the honour of God, the comming of his Kingdome, and the doing of his will; and if theſe concur not in his way, he would rather looſe them, then diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt by having of them; he hath a ſingleneſſe of heart in ſeeking ſpirituall bleſſings; he ſeekes them not for his owne ends, as you ſee in <hi>Davids</hi> deſire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3. <hi>My ſoule thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, to ſee thy power, and thy glory, as I have ſeene thee in the Sanctuary; becauſe thy loving kindneſſe is better then life, therefore my lips ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> He deſires not there the injoyment of the preſence of God, or the ſubduing of his luſts, that he might live at more eaſe, and have more comfort (though that be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full end) but he would ſee the power of Chriſt more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in him; he would ſee a mighty increaſe of the grace
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117852:29"/>of God in him, not that he might be more excellent then his neighbours, more eminent in gifts, and ſo be better then others, or ſo eſteemed; but he deſires that all his luſts may be ſwallowed up, and that the life of Chriſt might more mightily over-rule, and over-ſway him, and dwell mightily in him, that he might not live after his owne wil, nor to himſelfe, nor would he live by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit in him, but the life that he would live, is <hi>by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. that Chriſt and his life in him might worke all his workes in him and for him; and in that at any time he deſires death, it is not that he might be freed from evil and miſery, but that hee might be <hi>diſſolved, and be with Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.23. Though the other be a lawfull deſire, but chiefly his deſire is, that he might ſee Chriſt, whom from his firſt converſion he hath moſt loved, and in whom he hath lived all his life, and now to be wholly poſſeſſed of him, and wholly acted and ſwayed by him, not that he might have his heart filled with joy, but that he might be with Chriſt, not only as chiefeſt of ten thouſand perſons, but as the chiefeſt of ten thouſands benefits of God, that ſhould God give us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne, his Word and Sacrament, and victory over all our luſts, ſtrength of every grace of God, and everlaſting life, and therewith fellowſhip with all the bleſſed Saints and Angels, yet to us Chriſt is the chiefeſt of them all, none greater then the gift of Chriſt; and this is the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Chriſtians ſoule, he deſires more any benefit for Chriſts ſake, then Chriſt for any of his benefits ſake; for he whoſe heart is ſet upon Chriſt, more then upon the pardon of ſinne, or ſalvation, that ſoule hath Chriſt, and life in him; he that hath Chriſt in his eye and heart above all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, he indeed is a true Chriſtian, and hath Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Chriſt muſt ſo be had, and we muſt ſo receive him as God gives him; now God gives us firſt Chriſt in all his Ordinances, and then in Chriſt all other things, all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in and through Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.35. <hi>We preach to you Jeſus;</hi> we offer you him, all luſts layed aſide, all ſinfull corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons put away, whatever ſeparates between God and us,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117852:29"/>that being done away: We now offer you Chriſt, and in Chriſt plentious redemption; but if we be without Chriſt, we are without true life.</p>
            <p>As in the Sacrament, firſt you have the body and blood of Chriſt ſet before you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. and then ſealed up, and confirmed to you in the Sacrament, and together with that juſtification, and further degrees of the ſanctifying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and further pledges of everlaſting life, and glory; No benefit, but its conveyed through him; Chriſt firſt, and then the benefit. It is true, <hi>Herod</hi> received joy, but <hi>Foelix</hi> trembling, and <hi>Jehu</hi> zeale, but none of theſe received Chriſt; they received the huske, but wanted Chriſt; they had the ſhell, but not the marrow and kernell within; they received the benefit, but Chriſt they did not receive, and for want of him they had no life at all. <hi>Simon Magus hee beleeved, Acts</hi> 8.13. but he had no lively faith, becauſe he would receive the benefit, but Chriſt he minded not to receive: Unleſſe the heart be knit to Chriſt, and the ſoule more ſeek Chriſt then pardon of ſinne, or ſubduing of luſts, he hath no life in truth, <hi>he that hath the Son, he hath life;</hi> not ſo, he that hath the gifts and benefits of the ſon: But <hi>Christ firſt,</hi> and in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt we have all.</p>
            <p>Chriſt muſt be received as God gives him, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there is no life in any grace, but in Chriſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>On me is your fruit found, and without me can you do nothing John</hi> 15.5. Now then carry this truth home with you, and gather from hence a true eſtimate of your own eſtates, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you may judge of your ſelves as living or dead Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Upon our having or not having of Chriſt depends our having or not having of life. How will you know, whether you have life or no, you ſay you have Chriſt, how know you that? Whether is your hearts more ſet upon Chriſt, then the gifts of Chriſt; Whether do you labour more for gifts, or for Chriſt himſelfe. And if you finde this, that in the truth of your hearts, you come not to the Ordinances, but to find your beloved there, not out of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and wanton ſpirits, but to <hi>ſeeke him whom your ſoule moſt deſires;</hi> whoſe favour and countenance you would rather
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117852:30"/>behold, then to hear the voyce of a pleaſant ſinger, and you are not ſatisfied with any thing unleſſe you find him; then ſhal you find life in ſo coming to the Ordinances <hi>Can.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>By night in my bed I ſought him whom my ſoule loved, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>bed</hi> was the Temple, wherein God did reveale himſelfe in his Ordinances, and diſperſe himſelfe to his people in the bed of his love. Shee came to the Temple, not to ſeek any of the Preiſts and Levites there; She goes indeed to the <hi>Watch-men,</hi> and makes her moane and complaint to them, that ſhe could not finde Chriſt in his Ordinances, and ſhe durſt not reſt upon their opinions; but ſaith, have you not ſeen him whom my ſoul loveth? can you tel me any newes, or give me any intelligence of my beloved Saviour? Thus ſhe inquires of the Watch-men: And from them ſhe goes to the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Jeruſalem,</hi> to her Chriſtian friends and chargeth them to tell him, that ſhe is ſick of love. Now if thus to deſire him, is to find Chriſt, then there is no more to be doubted of in ſuch a caſe as this; But the heart thus ſeeking him in his Ordinances, and the affections gon after him there, more then after any of his benefits, then in truth we have the Sonne, he could not have our hearts, if we firſt had not him; And therefore it is a ſtrong evidence we have him, becauſe our hearts are ſet upon him. We ſearch for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as for him; This is part of the meaning of that place in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25 <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, or in earth in compariſon of thee?</hi> he deſires nothing more then him, neither peace of conſcience, nor joy in the Holy ghoſt, nor any thing ſo cheifly, and principally as God; but if wee have a longing affection after pardon of ſinne, and peace of conſcience, and aſſurance of ſalvation, after ſubduing of luſts and growth in grace; theſe be bleſſed deſires, and uſually upright, and ſincere, but there may be hypocriſie even in theſe very deſires, and in uſing the meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine theſe; for ſometimes by this meanes we ſeek Chriſt, and him in his Ordinances, not ſo much for himſelf, as for the benefits we have by him, which is a ſpirit of harlotry; As in a woman that it may bee hath a ſtrong affection to match with ſuch a man; but it is, but that hee might pay
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117852:30"/>her debts, and that ſhe might be well provided for, for the world, and that he might be availe, and a protector to her, theſe be lawfull ends to aime at; but if it be only and cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for theſe ends, it is not true conjugal affection, for if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man could do this for her as well as he, ſhe could make choyce of another as well as of him, and ſhe deſires him, not for his, but for her own ends; And juſt ſo it is alike in this caſe, If a man deſire the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to this end, that he may have his ſinne pardoned, and be furniſhed with grace, though theſe be ſpirituall ends, yet ſo much as wee prize the benefit above Chriſt, ſo much are we halting in the truth of our affection to him. If a woman in true conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall affection, looke at no more but at the very bare man,<note place="margin">True love to Chriſt wherein it is.</note> if there be true love in her towards him, ſhe is content to have him, though ſhe have nothing elſe but his perſon; ſo if our hearts be truly ſet upon Chriſt we are content to have him, though wee ſhould never ſee good day with him; though wee ſhould never ſee peace of conſcience with him, though no comfort of grace in him, yet would the ſoule ſay, that is truely affected to Chriſt, give me Chriſt, and I have enough, who, or what is there beſides Chriſt? What is there? Why, there is variety of excellent graces: But <hi>whom have I in earth but thee?</hi> As if ye ſhould put all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in compariſon againſt, or with Chriſt, they are nothing to him, then ſurely you have Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But how much will this diſcord from the fellowſhip of Chriſt, the Sonnes and Daughters of men, who when they ſee the coſtlineſſe of the wayes of Chriſt, they will neither ſeeke after Chriſt nor his benefits: But as for pardon of ſin, as it paſſeth all underſtanding, ſo it paſſeth their deſires; And for peace of conſcience, they hope they have a good conſcience; or if not, they doe not ſearch to know it; and as for the graces of the ſpirit, and ſubduing of luſts, they have a good hope, and beleive as well as the beſt: And for the Kingdome of glory, they hope if God grant them mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they ſhall come to heaven at the laſt: Theſe men are far from having the Lord Jeſus, and life in him; they are ſo far off from ſeeking the Sonne, as that they do not ſo much
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:117852:31"/>as ſeek thoſe mercies and benefits which in Chriſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to their ſoules, they neither have him nor none of his. <hi>They ſay to the Almighty depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledg of thy law,</hi> Job 21.14. of ſuch God ſaith, <hi>They would have none of me,</hi> Pſal. 81.11. not only <hi>have him,</hi> but <hi>none of him;</hi> that is, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was his, not any ſaving benefit of his; the world we would have, but none of thoſe choyce and heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Chriſt; no pardon of ſin, no peace of conſcience, no care of Chriſtianity, or faithfull Miniſtery, no feare of God, nor keeping of his Commandements; deare hearts for us, how ſhall we ever conceive that ever we ſhould have life in Chriſt, when we doe not ſo much as deſire the very benefits of Chriſt? which yet a man may deſire and looſe all too, and when a man hath not ſo much as an affection to the things of Chriſt it is very dangerous.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, when a man is in this caſe, that there is a deſire in a man after the benefits of Chriſt, more then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt himſelfe; all this while you want that ſincerity upon which Chriſt wil give us a comfortable meeting, and ſpeake peace to our ſoules; we are not yet come to that condition, as in which he wil ſay; My wel-beloved, thou art all faire, and there is no ſpot in thee, he yet ſees not a true conjugall affection in us towards him; ſo as that though we ſhould never finde grace nor glory by him, yet he is the chiefe deſire of our ſoules. Suppoſe a woman should ſee a man that hath a deſire after her, but he chiefly aimes at her eſtate, to provide for himſelfe, and looks no further, wonder not if ſhe ſhould ſay to him; You ſeek not me, but mine, ſhe may wel rid her hands of him in ſuch a caſe; and truly ſo is the caſe here between us &amp; the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſo long as he findes that we come to him, and ſeek, and pray, and wraſtle, and what would we have? Oh, pardon of ſinne, and peace of conſcience, and power of grace, to be but as other Chriſtians are; that we could pray, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve as they doe, and finde ſuch comfort as they have, and this is the thing that the ſoule is chiefly ſet upon; now all this while that we come thus to Chriſt, we muſt not think that Chriſt is to blame, if he tarry a little longer then we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:117852:31"/>expect, for we may ſeek him and not finde him, becauſe we ſeeke not ſo much him as his benefits, and the rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace, and mercy, and peace, that are layed up in him without meaſure; the greateſt part of the world doe not love their ſoules, nor the Lord Jeſus ſo wel, as to love him for his grace and goodneſſe ſake; but yet among bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men, there is a world of ſelfe love, many a man would have his ſinne pardoned, becauſe he would have his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at quiet; we may thanke our ſelves for ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe, not but that ſuch affections may ſpring from the grace of God, for men by nature never dreame of ſuch things as theſe be, but yet though ſuch affections may ſpring from the grace of God, yet you ſhall ever finde ſuch ſoules to detaine the grace of God in unrighteouſneſſe, and out of ſelfe love, uſe them all to their owne ends; and looke not that God may be glorified in and by them, nor that his wil be done; but oh, that the ſoule might have peace, and that ſinne might be pardoned, and there it reſts: When our deſires is chiefly ſet upon ſpirituall gifts, if wee looſe much comfort and fellowſhip with Chriſt, that elſe we might have had, we muſt not marvell at it, for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are ſet not chiefly upon Chriſt, but upon the things of Chriſt; our deſire is not after the perſon, but after the goods and benefits of Chriſt. Obſerve the Apoſtles expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He hath given us his owne Sonne;</hi> he doth not ſay, he that hath given us peace and pardon of ſinne, <hi>will not he give all other things alſo?</hi> Or, wil not he give us Chriſt? He reaſons not from Chriſts benefits, to Chriſt, but thus he reaſons; <hi>He that hath given us his owne Sonne, will with his Sonne,</hi> and after his Sonne, <hi>give us all other things.</hi> At the ſecond hand comes in all theſe benefits of pardon of ſinne, and ſtrength of grace, and power againſt our luſts, &amp;c. theſe things come in as attendants upon the former; and therefore if God give us firſt to looke at Chriſt, that in him we have life of juſtification, and ſanctification, and conſolation, eternall glory, peace, and grace, and all; then we have him, and life in him, elſe we may have the outward comforts, but ſtand long enough at Chriſts Bed-chamber
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117852:32"/>doore, before he let us in. Let it therefore be a word of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and exhortation, to every ſoul that deſires to have that truth of life, and peace, and grace wrought in his heart that wil never dye; have you reſpect chiefly to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and long and ſeeke more after him, then after all Spirituall bleſſings, and much more above all worldly bleſſings. If you ſhall therefore refuſe Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you thinke he is but a melancholly perſon, you wil never have him, if you ſtand upon ſuch terms, if you wil not have him unleſſe he be thus and thus qualified; then let him alone, never talke of him, reſt not in looking after any of his benefits, it is a good thing to looke for ſuch benefits as accompany Chriſt; but reſt not there, content not your ſelves in ſuch wraſtlings, never thinke you are of a right ſpirit, and that you have <hi>a lively life,</hi> and ſuch as by which you ſhall maintaine conſtant fellowſhip with God, unleſſe you finde your hearts longing after Chriſt; <hi>My ſoule is a thirſt for the living God,</hi> Pſal. 42.1, 2. Let your hearts be chiefly ſet upon him for his owne ſake, you can tell what it is to ſet your affections more upon a perſon then upon their eſtate; and you muſt know, that your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are more ſet upon Chriſt, then upon any benefit he hath, unleſſe you finde Chriſt more then his gifts, you ſhall finde little peace in your way; you muſt ſee that all, even the worſt of his things are beautifull and comly, and is more to be deſired then Gold, is ſweeter then the Honey, or the Honey-combe; he that thus hath the Sonne he hath life, the Sonne of God; God and Man, as he is our Son, and our Saviour; let the deſire of your ſoule be unto him, and your affections run out after him; be you for him, and then he wil be for you, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. Stand not ſo much upon this, what Chriſt wil be for you, but be ſure that you be for him; let friends and all goe, and be ſure you be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him: Though Chriſt love us firſt, yet he wil make us no aſſurance of his love to us, till he ſee us love him; and if we chuſe him firſt, before and above all his benefits, then we ſhall have him; make him then your aſſurance, and your Kingdome ſhall not be ſhaken; thinke not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117852:32"/>that he wil make you a feoffement before you be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to him, but we muſt be content to come to him, and take him as he is, and ſtand upon no conditions with him; You muſt not looke for aſſurance of Chriſts benefits till you have himſelfe, and if you chuſe him, then you ſhall have aſſurance to your ſoules, that he hath choſen you firſt; you cannot aske more then hee wil give; but firſt you muſt have himſelfe, he wil <hi>give you a kingdome,</hi> but you muſt firſt <hi>be a little flocke, all is yours,</hi> and <hi>ye are Chriſts,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt is Gods.</hi> Thus chuſe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all his benefits, and you ſhall have him, and life in him.</p>

            <p>Firſt, The ſpirit of God, whereſoever it is ſhed abroad in any member of Chriſt, it doth make us one with the Lord Jeſus, it unites us into one fellowſhip of nature, a likeneſſe in affection and diſpoſition, and a likeneſſe in all the graces of God, as <hi>John</hi> 17.21. our Saviour prayes the Father, <hi>that all thoſe whom he had given him might bee one with him, as thou and I art one:</hi> thou in me by thy ſpirit, and I in thee, by the ſame ſpirit; and this ſpirit is ſuch as makes not onely mee, one with thee, but them alſo, one with mee; and they alſo in like ſort, one with another; it makes us and Chriſt us it were one: Hence it is, that as ſoone as we receive him, we <hi>of his fullneſſe receive grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1.16. There is a conformity between Chriſt and us; one and the ſame Image ſtamped upon us both, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. a like in grace, a like in affection, and in continuance of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, a like in every thing.</p>
            <p>For a little further clearing of the point. The ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt being ſhed abroad into the heart of every one that hath Chriſt, doth worke a threefold conformity
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:117852:34"/>or likeneſſe betweene Chriſt and us.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity between Chriſt and his.</note> A likeneſſe in Nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A likeneſſe in Offices,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In Eſtate, both of humiliation and exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And all this is done by the mighty power of the ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the Nature of Chriſt, by the precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God which are made unto us,<note place="margin">The firſt Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> and which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth apply to us, <hi>We are made partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. There is a likeneſſe and a participation of the divine nature, and we are made partakers of the like grace in Chriſt Jeſus, and that <hi>grace for grace:</hi> Look what grace any where, you ſee in Chriſt, the reſemblance of it is ſtamped upon every child of God, by the ſpirit of Chriſt: Hence it comes to paſſe, that (which is worth your obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) thoſe who have Chriſt, they doe reaſon from the nature of Chriſt to juſtifie, the temper of their owne ſpirits, and the courſe of their own lives, as is the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> owne Argument, in 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. Some of the falſe Apoſtles tooke up an Argument againſt the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to prove his levity, and inconſtancy, and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and how doth he free himſelfe, <hi>did I uſe lightneſſe?</hi> no ſaith he, <hi>our words toward you, was not yea, and nay;</hi> and thus he reaſons from Chriſts nature, <hi>The Sonne of God who was preached among you, was not yea and nay, but yea and amen: Now he which eſtabliſheth us with you, is Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> So that looke as <hi>Christ is yea and amen, the faithfull and true witneſſe of God,</hi> what he ſpeakes he confirmes, and fulfills in due ſeaſon. Now ſaith he, when Chriſt was preached among you, it was not an uncertain Chriſt, carryed about with lightneſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettledneſſe; but what is once gone out of his lips, It is yea and amen. Therefore make account, that God that hath poured the ſame ſpirit upon us, hath <hi>eſtabliſhed us together with you.</hi> To ſhew you that by reaſon of the participation of the ſpirit of grace, there is ſuch a ſpirit in us, as that you may argue all theſe; the nature of Chriſt, the nature of the Goſpell, and the nature of the frame of grace in the hearts of Gods people, to be all alike; they do mutually ſhew the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117852:34"/>face one of another, in the frame and carriage one of another: That as Chriſt is yea and amen, ſo is the Goſpell, and ſuch are they that beleeve the Goſpell, and are eſtabliſhed by the Goſpel in Chriſt Jeſus, v. 21.2. <hi>And he hath ſealed us, and given us the ſpirit in our hearts,</hi> the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt that breathed in the Goſpell, and in the Preachers of the Goſpell, and the beleevers of it, is yea and amen in them all; a ſpirit of truth, and innocency, and gravity, and purity, whatſoever is the ſpirit of the one, is the ſpirit of them all: So that this is an evident ſigne, that wee have Chriſt, when we have the ſpirit of Chriſt; when you may reaſon alike the one from the other, though in us it be the weaker, by reaſon of a ſpirit of corruption found in us, and not in Chriſt: Yet this is an evident argument of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billity and gravity of our hearts, which though in regand of weakneſſe, we might think the Apoſtle might have been excepted againſt, yet becauſe there is no weakneſſe in a child of God, but if he have Chriſt, his heart is in the ſame condition with Chriſt, and with the Goſpel alſo: therefore he may comfortably argue a likeneſſe between them; what he ſpeakes, that he thinkes in his heart, and it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his ſoul that it may be effected: And though he may be hindred, yet his heart is ſtill the ſame, and he was by no meanes to bee taxed of any lightneſſe, becauſe he did not performe his word, the fault was not his levity; his ſpirit was the ſame, but ſome occaſion fell out otherwiſe by the providence of God: And ſo it is with every child of God, if he have Chriſt; the ſpirit of a Chriſtian, is ever the ſame; if there ſhould be any inclination to lying; and inconſtancy, the frame of the ſpirit is altered, but the true bent and frame of a Chriſtian, <hi>is to be one with Chriſt, as Chriſt is one with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Now as there is a likeneſſe and conformity,<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</note> and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in nature, between Chriſt and a child of God, ſo there is alſo in us, a conformity to Chriſt in his Offices, The meaning is, Whoſoever hath the Son, he hath the offices which the Sonne hath. As he was <hi>both King, Prieſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to God his Father,</hi> ſo are we, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. As Kings, to rule over all our luſts, and to rule all thoſe whom God commends
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:117852:35"/>to our Government according unto God: As <hi>Kings,</hi> to get victory and to conquer over the World, and to over-wraſtle any difficulty as we meete with: As <hi>Kings,</hi> anoynted with the ſpirit of a King, of a royall ſpirit, though not inveſted with fulneſſe of glory till the laſt day, yet of an heroyicke noble ſpirit, can eaſily over-look all earthly drudgery, and reſiſt any enemy we meet with.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Prieſts</hi> alſo we are, ſo as we are able to offer up ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of prayer, and thankſgiving to God, <hi>A broken and an humble heart is a Sacrifice,</hi> much ſet by of God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.17. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.17. <hi>offered upon the ſacrifice, and ſervice of your faith,</hi> We are now inabled to go to God, and to offer up praiſes to him, which are as <hi>inſence</hi> before him, and in offering up any other ſacrifice of an holy life, we are Prieſts unto God the Father.</p>
            <p>And ſo are we alſo <hi>Prophets, Acts</hi> 2.17. hee poures out his ſpirit in a rich and plentifull meaſure; he poures out his ſpirit <hi>upon all fleſh;</hi> whence it comes to paſſe, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God underſtand many ſecrets of Gods counſell, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 25.14. and whence alſo it comes to paſſe, that many a godly man by the ſame ſpirit diſcernes many ſecret hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den myſteries, and meanings of the Holy Ghoſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more then ever he could by any reading or inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and many times diſcernes ſome ſpeciall work of the ſpirit of God, which inables them to fore-ſee ſome ſpeciall bleſſings, moſt uſefull for their ſpirituall eſtate, and ſo leads them on to many good things which they did little thinke of, and ſo makes them of <hi>Propheticall ſpirits,</hi> and bowes them to teach others alſo, to lead on others of their neighbours in the wayes of God.</p>
            <p>And now I ſay that as theſe be the Offices of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo there is no child of God that hath <hi>the Son,</hi> but he hath all theſe in him, hee is now a man of a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and Prieſtly, and Prophetical ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And you are hereby (I meane by the ſpirit) not onely called to theſe Offices, but inabled to diſcharge them: For that is the difference, between a Chriſtian in heart, and a Chriſtian in appearance, fall ſhort of ability to performe theſe Offices.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:117852:35"/>
            <p> And as there is this conformity to the Nature and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt in them that have the Sonne; So Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> there is a conformity in their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> you know Chriſt waded through an Eſtate of <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>exaltation:</hi> Theſe bee the main Principles of Religion; that looke as it was with Chriſts eſtate, it was ſometime, the time wherein hee was humbled in this world, all the courſe of his life was a time of humiliation, and that unto the very death, or elſe his ſtate of exaltation in heaven: that then when he was moſt mortified, then was he moſt glorified, triumphing openly and mightily, ſhewing forth himſelf to be the Son of God, even then when in mans ſight, hee was ſeparated from God, &amp; baniſhed from the Church, ſo as that al men cried, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him, crucifie him,</hi> and al his own Diſciples forſook him, and not a ſoul acknowledged him, but one poor theefe upon the croſſe with him; yet even then was he ſo gloriouſly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, as that well might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>he triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly upon the croſſe, having therein made a ſpoyle of Principallities and Powers, Col.</hi> 2.15. Now this very eſtate is the eſtate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very child of God; and ſo farre as hee hath the Sonne, ſo far doth he expreſſe this eſtate in his whole converſation, (for an eſtate of humiliation) <hi>great and many be the afflictions of the righteous, Pſalm.</hi> 34.18, 19. there is their debaſement in the world; <hi>but the Lord delivereth them out of all,</hi> there is their exaltation mixed together; many wayes humbled, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted deliverances, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 149.4,5. <hi>The Lord will beautifie the meeke with ſalvation;</hi> that is, hee will beautifie them by their manifold deliverances. Nay, beſides deliverances, you ſhall finde this to be the beautifull frame of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Gods people in their eſtates. Take it in their outward condition in the World, an eſtate of means, and affliction; if he be a man of a faire outward eſtate, and of good means in the world, yet you ſhall ſee a marvellous ſpirit of ſelfe-deniall in him, ſo as that in the middeſt of many worldly comforts, he fits looſe from them, and lives beſides them; theſe are not the things that he hath ſet his heart upon, as our Savior ſaid to his diſciples, concerning the ſtones of the Temple, ſo as that though God had don much for them, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:117852:36"/>given them many comforts, yet there is a more hidden matter in their hearts, better then theſe things can reach unto, they are not a Chriſtians crowne and glory, but <hi>he is crucified to them, and they unto him,</hi> Gal. 6.14.</p>
            <p>And if ſo be, that God give him any great or eminent gifts of Spirituall grace, it is ſtrange to ſee how they are clad in him, with a garment of Chriſt crucified, over ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed in ſelfe deniall; as they ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> meane in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view, and ſpeech of little or no value, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. and yet even in this very meanneſs which any of them labour under, in regard of want of outward things, and all their meanneſs and lowneſſe of carriage, and ſelfe-deniall of all the outward bleſſings and contentments they have received, yet you ſhall ſee a mighty power of Chriſt, triumphing in the baſeneſſe, and mortifiedneſſe of a Chriſtian ſoule, ſo as that the Apoſtle fitly and ſutably expreſſes their eſtate; <hi>Though he was crucified through weakneſſe, yet he liveth by the power of God; for we alſo are weak in him, but we ſhall alſo live with him by the power of God.</hi> So that as it was with Chriſt in his eſtate, ſo it is with us in our eſtate, <hi>weake in him;</hi> meaning, that as Chriſt in his outward Man ſeemed to be weake, and contemptible, ſo we (as it is in the Originall) are <hi>weake with him,</hi> but we <hi>ſhall live with him by the power of God;</hi> ſo that ſuppoſe Chriſt be indeed weake in outward view, ſo as he that lookes once, would not looke twice at him, yet when he ſeemes to be moſt weake and baſe, then is he moſt powerfull and glorious, and ſo the very death of Chriſt, wherein he is moſt expoſed to ſuch infirmities as follow mans nature, yet then he performes the greateſt worke of our Redemption, ſatisfies the Fathers wrath for us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us pardon of ſinne, and redeemes us from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Hel, and purchaſes for us a ſpirit of grace, and power; and truly there is a certaine kinde of conformity even in this very point, between the Lord Jeſus and every ſervant of Chriſt; as he is weake, ſo are we; as he dyes, ſo doe we; as he is in his greateſt debaſements, and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo it is with us. And hence it is that ye read theſe Phraſes in Scripture, <hi>We are dead with Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.20. and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117852:36"/>
               <hi>riſen with Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.1. and <hi>crucified with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6.6. Now theſe be ſtrange Phraſes, that Chriſt who is dead one thouſand ſix hundred yeares agoe, and riſen againe ſo long ſince; what is this which the Apoſtle ſaith, we are thus <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>crucified,</hi> and <hi>riſen</hi> with Chriſt? What is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of his diſcourſe? The true meaning is, that by the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt which was ſhed abroad into his heart above meaſure, we are ſo knit unto Chriſt, as that we are not only of the like <hi>nature</hi> with him, but of like <hi>eſtate</hi> with Chriſt; that as he was in this world, ſo are we while we are in the world, weake as he, yea glorious as he; and as he roſe againe out of all contempt, and reproach, and perſecution, ſo doe we riſe againe (out of all our many and great afflictions) mightily by the ſame power of the ſame Spirit of the Lord Jeſus; ſo that this is a point that inwardly flowes from this having of Chriſt; he that hath the Sonne hath the ſpirit of the Sonne, whereby he is made one with Chriſt in <hi>Nature,</hi> in <hi>Offices,</hi> and in his <hi>eſtate;</hi> and this is evident in the experience of Gods ſervants, and by testimony of the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture. And therefore examine we our ſelves in this particular, if we have the Son, we have the ſpirit of the Son.</p>
            <p>The ſecond worke of the Spirit is, that it is not only a ſpirit of union, but it is alſo a ſpirit of liberty;<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits liberty</note> for of all the kindes of temper in a Sonne, there is nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the frame of a Sonne (next to his likeneſſe, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Father) then liberty doth; <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17. <hi>And if the Sonne have made you free, then are you free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8.36. It is a reall liberty if the Sonne ſhall give you liberty, and he ſpeakes of ſuch a liberty as appertaines to Sons, and not to Servants that may be turned out of doores; but the <hi>Sonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in the houſe for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is a ſtrange kind of liberty which the children of God are advanced to by the ſpirit of the Son; it is a phraſe of much importance, <hi>A ſpirit of liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, liberty from the feare of ſinne,<note place="margin">Liberty from feare of ſinne.</note> and the feare of Hell, from feare of the Grave, and of all the enemies of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:117852:37"/>our Salvation; a freedome from feare of any of them. A Servant if he offend, is afraid of extremity from his Maſter, but the Sonne walkes with more liberty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Wee have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba Father.</hi> We looke at God as a Father, and we walke before him not in feare, but in liberty; and therefore we are free from the feare of death, to which, <hi>ſome are all their life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2.14, 15. Now this is a ſpirit of liberty, to have the heart ſet free from all feares, it is the ſumme of all ſecurity, he hath redeemed us, <hi>That we might ſerve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare all the dayes of our lives,</hi> Luk. 1.74, 75.78. We are free from feare of Death, and Hell, and of the World, and we doe not <hi>feare what fleſh can doe unto us,</hi> Pſal. 3.5, 6. his meaning is, That the feares of men ſhould not breake his ſleep, but he would walke in a child-like confidence before God and man, and he would <hi>lye him downe</hi> quietly, <hi>and ſleepe</hi> ſecurely, <hi>though ten thouſand had compaſſed him round about;</hi> and the like you read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3. <hi>What time I am afraid I will truſt in thee.</hi> And verſ. 11. <hi>In God will I put my truſt, I will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid what man can doe unto me.</hi> It is an uſuall phraſe with <hi>David,</hi> and the uſuall frame of the ſpirits of Gods people, and this kinde of holy tranquillity of heart, and liberty to walk with even neſſe and comfort of ſoule, againſt all the feares of this and another world; this kinde of inward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from all feare,<note place="margin">Naturall property of a ſon.</note> is the naturall property of a Sonne; a ſonne never greatly feares ill meaſures from his Father, all his care is, to approve himſelfe to his Fathers will, and then he knowes his Fathers care is more for his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and protection then his owne can be; and if at any time he fall ſhort of doing his Fathers will, he makes his peace with his father upon as good termes as he can, and there he reſts; but this is his fathers will, and you need not poſſeſſe him of that, and if he be a ſonne he will looke for protection from his father. A childe of God knowes, his heavenly Father will ſupport him, and he feares not what ſinne, and Hell, and the Grave, and Death can doe unto him; he feares not perſecution, nor ſword, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the Lord is with him, and he feares none of them;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:117852:37"/>
               <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that in all theſe, we are more then conquerours,</hi> Rom. 8.37, 38. this is the liberty of the ſpirit of a ſonne.</p>
            <p>Now as there is by the Spirit in the heart of the Childe of God, liberty from all feare of ſinne,<note place="margin">Liberty from pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſin.</note> ſo he hath liberty from all the power and dominion of ſinne; he is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the dominion and bondage of ſinne, ſinne hath not that power over him as to carry him captive to it; but he <hi>walkes at liberty,</hi> Pſal. 119. and therefore at liberty, becauſe <hi>he is not under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. And nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is that ſpeech in Chap. 8.2. <hi>The law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, hath freed me from the law of ſinne, and of death: The ſpirit of life,</hi> viz. That ſpirit of life which hath a legall power in it, a power like a law, and hath a ruling power over me as the law hath; and in both theſe reſpects called, <hi>A Law of God;</hi> A kinde of ſpirituall life, becauſe there is a lively ſpirit in him: And this law of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life of Grace <hi>hath freed me,</hi> ſet me at liberty from the law and trade of ſinne, and of death; ſinne and death ſet him a courſe and trade, which this Law of the Spirit of life hath ſet him free from, ſo as that he is but a bungler in ſin now; not now learned in the law of ſinne, as ſometimes he hath been; but the Law of the Spirit of life hath freed him from the skill of ſinne, and from the command of ſinne; the law of ſinne hath had a ſoveraigne power over him, but now he is freed from the act and trade of ſinne, and now he walkes at liberty, even from the dominion, and uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne; time hath been when nothing would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, and he could have followed evil company, and unlawfull games, they were as lawfull to him as to any, and he had no power to reſiſt them; but now <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life</hi> hath helped him againſt them all, this is another part of the ſpirit of liberty, a liberty from the bondage and dominion of ſinne, and it is a marvellous comfortable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty indeed; many a vallourous ſpirited man, hath ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle feare of death, that he ruſhes upon the Pikes as the Horſe into the Battell, as if it were their meat and drinke; but yet he wants this liberty, he is not at liberty from feare
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:117852:38"/>of danger by the redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, valiant, becauſe ignorant of the danger.</p>
            <p>And beſides, ſuch a naturall man, though he be of a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous ſpirit in reſpect of fear of danger, yet ſuch a man is often captivated of many baſe luſts, and ſinfull courſes, and is not able to reſiſt ill counſell, nor ill company; whereas a godly man is free from all theſe; free from the bondage, and dominion of ſinne, and all the law of ſinne he looks at it as a <hi>cobweb-law,</hi> which hee may eaſily breake through, and accordingly doth ſo, and overcomes all his former ſinfull luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Freedome from ſins Service.</note> Thirdly, There is another frame of this ſpirit of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as it is the Spirit of the Sonne, it frees us from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. Not that it forbids civill ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: not ſo to make men free, but if God have called you a ſervant, live as a ſervant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12. to 20. but uſe your liberty the rather if you can, but if you muſt needs be a ſervant, then know, <hi>that he that is a ſervant, is the Lords free man, but be not ye the ſervants of men,</hi> that is, though you owe and doe your bodily ſervice to men, yet towards God walk at liberty; and if thy labour be great, and thy reward lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet doe thy ſervice, and looke for more wages at the hand of Chriſt (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.23.) then from men; in ſerving men ſerve Chriſt; and therefore goe about your Maſters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>not with eye ſervice, but in ſingleneſſe of heart ſerving the Lord, and not men;</hi> in ſerving of men, they do faithfull and diligent ſervice to the Lord, and therefore they do it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and not grudgingly, but in much quietneſſe of ſpirit, and are more free for Chriſtian duties, and have more quiet time for ſeeking God then ever after, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22. <hi>He that is married careth for the things of the world,</hi> And it is true, he that is moſt free, is but a ſervant to Chriſt, but a free ſervant though: But he that is a ſervant is <hi>the Lords free-man,</hi> the meaning is, not only to doe the worke of his owne ſervice with a free ſpirit, but he is not onely a free man when he is moſt bound, but then hee goes about the ſervice of God with much more liberty of ſpirit, then when he is his own man.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:117852:38"/>
            <p> It is oft times wonder to ſee ſervants, being called, what care they will have of Chriſtian dutyes, what time they will ſteal to call upon God, and to examin themſelves,<note place="margin">Note this</note> and what a grief it is to them to ſee this and that duty neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the family; and they are very free to God: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when they come to be Free men, and are for themſelves, that they may now have as much liberty as they will, pray when they will, and take what time they will, to inſtruct thoſe that are about them, which time they wanted when they were ſervants, and which they then mourned under: And yet whereas then they would ſerve God with much freedome and liberty of ſpirit, were then free from the law of ſinne, and free for any duty: There is now a ſecret kind of bondage come upon them, their hearts is more imbondaged, and inſnared, and imcombred, and intangled; and ſo dutyes come not to be performed, either with that conſtancy, and care, or not with that inlargement of heart, as they were, when they were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; And therefore that is the reaſon why the Apoſtle bids them, not bee over-ready to challenge freedom.</p>
            <p>But this ſhewes you that there is a marvellous liberty, even in thoſe that are ſervants, they are free from the ſervice of men in their hearts and conſciences; and then moſt at liberty to ſerve God, when they are moſt bound to ſerve men: yet in their hearts and conſciences they are free from their ſervice; they are not bound in conſcience to doe any thing but what is the will of God, and this is a marvellous great freedom, that a man is not bound to become a ſlave to other mens wil, and to do as other men do, he is not bound to do any thing that is unlawfull, and this is a ſpirit of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that makes even a ſervant to have a ſpirit of freedome; he is a Free-man, his heart is free to Gods Service, and this is from nothing elſe but from this ſpirit of a ſonne, a ſpirit of liberty.</p>
            <p>Now on the contrary ſide, as by this ſpirit of liberty, a Childe of God is free from the feare of ſinne, ſo he hath a certaine kinde of priviledge of peace in his ſoule, and of freeneſſe and readineſſe to every Chriſtian duty; and alſo
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:117852:39"/>he hath a certaine priviledge of dominion over all the Creatures. It is the nature, and proper definition of liberty, Freedome from evil, and liberty unto the enjoyment of ſome good things; it ſets me free from ſinne, and gives me liberty and peace of conſcience from the ſame Spirit of the Lord Jeſus; it ſets me at liberty to <hi>run the way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> Pſal. 119.32. And Gods people are a <hi>willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. This is indeed a ſpirit of liberty, it inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me to dominion over men; no Creature in heaven or in earth, but a Chriſtian is able to rule him to his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; a Chriſtian ſervant wil turne his Maſters govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his advantage, and ſo all his enemies tyranny; he will be ſure to be better by them all, and he wil grow and thrive in his ſpirit by all the dangers and evils that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him in this world; I know not in what better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then in that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. The Oracle of God ſaid to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> the <hi>elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> And this is a thing in much diſpute among Divines, wherein this was ever made good, and ſay, That <hi>Eſau</hi> was never a ſervant to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> for you ſhall finde in the 32. and 33. Chapters of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> uſes this word, <hi>My Lord Eſau,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches his Lordſhip <hi>to goe before,</hi> and <hi>his ſervant would follow after;</hi> and ſo it ſtood in their outward condition. And Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay, Though the promiſe be true of the perſons both ſeperate from the Wombe, yet the ſervice was not ſo. But we need not ſtraighten our ſelves for the explication of it, for <hi>Eſaus</hi> Lording and domineering over <hi>Jacob,</hi> was as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſpirit, as if he had layed aſide his ſtate, and come and ſerved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and kept his Sheep; the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Eſau</hi> againſt him, did him more reall ſervice, then all the ſervice of all <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſervants could reach him. Whence was it that <hi>Iacob</hi> went a Pilgrimage from his Fathers houſe? and that in a ſtrange Country God ſo proſpered him, that whereas he went out but with his <hi>ſtaffe</hi> in his hand, he returned back againe with <hi>two bands,</hi> or <hi>two droves?</hi> And whence was it that <hi>Iacob</hi> made ſuch <hi>a ſolemne Vow</hi> to God, and kept it in ſo much faithfulneſſe, that if God would <hi>keepe him in that journey, God ſhould be his God for ever.</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:117852:39"/>Did not all this come from the rage, and wrath of <hi>Eſau</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him? <hi>Eſau</hi> did him that good ſervice, and when he came back againe, and heard newes, that <hi>Eſau</hi> came <hi>out with foure hundred men</hi> againſt him, and thought to come to ſpoyle them all; what a marvellous ſervice was this to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> as you may read, Chap. 32. from 9. to the end; <hi>Eſau</hi> by this meanes ſet him on wraſtling with God by prayer, and therefore wraſtles with God all that night, and ſo wraſtles, that God changes his name upon it; <hi>Thou ſhalt not be called</hi> Jacob, <hi>a wrastler, but</hi> Iſrael <hi>a Prevailer; thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with God, and thou ſhalt prevaile with men.</hi> And now he is paſt the worſt with his Brother, and when he meets him, expreſſes much naturall affection, and is marvellous glad to ſee him, and offers to help him to drive his flocks, to ſhew you, that the very emulation, and envie, and cruelty, and ragings of the enemies of Gods Servants, even when they are moſt incenſed againſt them, and moſt tread them down, and inſult over them, then they doe them the greateſt ſervice that is poſſible to be done, through the mighty power of the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that turnes all into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries; that even when men doe moſt domineere over them, then they doe them the beſt ſervice. Looke as it was with the Tyrants of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that made waſte of Gods people. It is a notable ſpeech, that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.35, 36. It is <hi>to purge them,</hi> and <hi>to cleanſe them, and make them white.</hi> A Scullion in the Kitchin, when he ſcoures his Pewter, when he firſt takes it in hand, you would thinke he would quite ſpoile it, but he but ſcoures and cleares it up, and makes it more bright then it was before; the end of all is, but to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filth, and to make it cleare and bright. And ſo an Huſwife that takes her linning, ſhe Sopes it, and bedawbs it, and it may be defiles it with dung, ſo as it neither looks nor ſmels wel, and when ſhe hath done; ſhe rubs it, and buckes it, and wrings it, and in the end all this is but to make it cleane and white; and truly ſo it is here, when as Tyrants moſt of all inſult over Gods people, and ſcoure them and lay them in Lee, or Dung, ſo as the very name of them ſtinks, yet what is this but to purge them, and to make
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:117852:40"/>them white, and it is a great ſervice they doe to the people of God in ſo doing, and this is a great meaſure of liberty, that a Childe of God can tell how to make an advantage of all the afflictions he meets with in this world, theſe things doe but ſerve his turne, and afterward he wil ſay, he could have miſſed none of them; ſo that this is a ſecond worke of the ſpirit of the Sonne, it is a ſpirit of liberty.</p>
            <p>Onely take this word for a Concluſion, And that is thus much; Examine now, and try whether you have the Son or no, which you may know by your having or not having the ſpirit of the Son. Say then, have you the ſpirit of the Son? <hi>viz.</hi> have you that ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that makes you to be of one and the ſame nature with him, of the ſame Offices, and ſame Eſtate with him, can you find this in truth, and that with comfort and honeſty you may reaſon; this is the frame of my ſpirit, ſuch is the Spirit of Chriſt. And ſuch is the ſpirit of the godly, and if in any thing you faile, your ſpirit is againſt it; do you find that you are in ſome meaſure inveſted with a royall ſpirit, that you can over-come your ſelves, and the temptations of this world; and are you able to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifice to God, of prayer and praiſes? And doe you finde a ſpirit of Propheſie ſhed abroad into you, that makes you ſenſible of, and privie to the ſecret paths of God? Doe you finde that Chriſt was moſt glorious when he was moſt humbled? and ſo are you; and when you enjoy outward bleſſings, your hearts are not puffed up with them; theſe are not the <hi>goodly ſtones</hi> that your hearts and eyes are ſet upon, but you have greater matters then theſe to minde; then I ſay, it is the very Spirit of Chriſt that makes you to dye with Chriſt, as well as Chriſt to dye for you; he may dye for many men, but he only dyes with thoſe that are brought on to the fellowſhip of his grace; if a Spirit of Chriſt ſo knit you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that he is yours, and you are his, then you have the Sonne, becauſe you have the ſpirit of the Sonne, becauſe you are ſonnes, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts; but now if there be no proportion, no conformity to Chriſt in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117852:40"/>patient and meek as he is, And though we be not ſuch, yet we allow our ſelves, in not being ſuch, and are ever and anon ſtarting aſide from him: And if we have not his Offices, nor rule over our luſts, nor over the world; and we can neither pray nor propheſie, and ſhew forth no ſpirituall life in our lives, cannot deny our ſelves that wee may ſhew forth the hidden man of the heart, then conſider, that for the preſent we have not yet Chriſt, becauſe we have not the ſpirit of Chriſt. And alſo, if we be not yet free from the fear of death; And take no care to be free from the dominion, and power of ſinne, but ſinne hath ſtill a power over us like a law, and are not yet free from the ſervice of men, but as our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Governours, ſay, ſo it muſt be; if we yet know not how to rule men for our own advantage, we have not yet received the ſpirit of Chriſt; wee cannot tell how to ſerve our Maſters with liberty of ſpirit, we know not how to make advantage of them.</p>

            <p>You may remember we ſaid, there was three notes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern whether we had the Son no.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, if we deſired not Chriſt for his benefits, but cheifly for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was, If we have received the ſpirit of the Sonne.</p>
            <p>We now come to ſpeake of a third ſigne, a point more eaſie to be gathered then the former, but though moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet not to be neglected; but being well applyed, will bee of ſpeciall uſe to the edification, and ſalvation of the hearers, for every truth in his place, is divine and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

            <p>There is no man that hath the Son, but as he hath him for his Saviour ſo he hath him for his Prince, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It is an uſuall ſaying, every man would have Chriſt for a Saviour, but rare are thoſe, that will have him for their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Governour. But though the ſaying be true in reſpect of the common conceit of men, yet in truth I ſay, they are but rare Chriſtians that wil have him for a Saviour, ſo far off are they from deſiring him as their Lord.</p>
            <p>For two things there be that goe to the having of Chriſt for a Saviour.<note place="margin">To have Chriſt for a Savior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires two things.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, He that will have Chriſt for a Saviour, muſt look up to him for ſalvation in all his wayes, and diſtreſſes, we have other Saviours, but not him, if we looke for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on elſe-where, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40.22. <hi>Look unto me all ye ends of the earth, and be ye ſaved,</hi> there is no God nor Saviour beſides me, &amp; therefore look to me, and be ye ſaved. So that if a man wil have God for his Savior, he muſt look to him from one end of the earth to the other, we are at the utmoſt corner of the earth, and if we will be ſaved we muſt looke up to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation, as <hi>David</hi> looked towards the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for ſalvation, ſo they who look towards the Lord Jeſus for ſalvation, may be ſaved in what place ſoever they are, waite for ſalvation, from him, and long for ſalvation by him, and look not to any means, but ſo far as they are guided and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by him, and in whatſoever diſtreſſes you are, whether in conſcience or in diſtreſſe, through bodily ſickneſſe, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:117852:42"/>pennury, or impriſonment, yet look to me, and bee yee ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>You may read the like in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I will waite upon the Lord that hideth his face from the Houſe of Iſrael, and will looke for him.</hi> The Prophet at that time ſaw the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> much diſtempered, and in much diſtreſſe, both in regard of ſinne and miſery; Now for him to look for, or expect ſuch Princes as might reforme it in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; or ſuch Prieſts as might reforme things amiſſe in the Church, it had been a vain thing, for they were all bent to backſliding, till the wrath of God burſt out, and took hold upon them, but though there was no hope in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Princes, nor Prieſts, yet <hi>I will waite upon the Lord that hideth his face from the Houſe of Jacob, and will look for him.</hi> Though God ſuffer all things to go to wrack and ruine, yet I will waite for him, and look for ſalvation from him, and by him; ſo that ſuppoſe God ſhould hide his face from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoul of us, that we lye in <hi>darknes and in the ſhaddow of death,</hi> or if that we ſhould ſee our ſelves in diſtreſſe of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, or ſee Church or Commonwealth in many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſtempers; it is not now for a man to look about him, hither or thither for help and ſuccor, but <hi>to the holy one of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:</hi> And this is indeed to have him for a Saviour: he that hath him for a Saviour waites for him in all diſtreſſes. So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 17.7 the time will come when God will gather his people unto him, <hi>as the gleanings of berryes, when they ſhall be left like the ſhaking of an Olive tree, two or three berryes in the top of the uppermoſt bough; four or five in the outmoſt fruitfull branches ſaith the Lord.</hi> Now, <hi>at that time ſhall a man looke to his maker, and his eyes ſhall have reſpect to the holy one of Iſrael.</hi> Which ſhewes you, that thoſe who are Gods gleaned ones from the World, that are brought on to fellowſhip with Chriſt in the Election and Salvation; theſe are they <hi>who look to their Maker, and their eyes are unto him, the holy one of Iſrael.</hi> And ſo God is ſaid to be, not becauſe he is ſo in himſelfe, but becauſe, he makes <hi>Iſrael</hi> his holy one, and therefore his eyes hath reſpect unto him, you know in the caſt of an eye, wee ſhew reſpect; when the creature lookes after this and that in the World, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:117852:42"/>faſtens and ſets his eye upon any thing there, he hath no reſpect to the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but to the Creature only; but when the Creature being conſcious of his owne inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to help it ſelfe, by any meanes it ſelfe can uſe, but hath reſpect to the holy God that makes <hi>Iſrael</hi> holy, and is acknowledged of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be holy; this is indeed to have God for our Saviour, and ſo he is to all ſuch as are gathered together unto him.</p>
            <p>This is livelily expreſt in the example of good <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. he ſought the Lord, and in the audience of the people he made a ſolemne prayer to God, and concludes with this, in the latter end of the twelfth verſe; <hi>We know not what to ſay or to doe, but our eyes are unto thee.</hi> Now this having our eyes upon him in time of diſtreſſe, whether of Warre, or Peſtilence, or famine, or anguiſh of conſcience, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and yet we have our eyes towards the Holy one of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> we know not what to doe, and our power wil not reach us any helpe without Gods bleſſing, no not in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, but our eyes are unto him; this argues, that ſurely <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> had the Lord for his Saviour, becauſe he had ſuch reſpect unto him. Notable is that expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.1. <hi>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hils, from whence commeth my help; it commeth even from the Lord.</hi> The Lord dwelt upon mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and mount <hi>Moriab;</hi> there he manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his Ordinances, and therefore he put not his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the vallies and pits of the City, but in him that dwels in the hils, and lookes for ſalvation from thence, as he expounds himſelfe in the next words; <hi>My help commeth even from the Lord:</hi> So then, if ſo be that we doe indeed look up unto the Lord for ſalvation, and for help and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deliverance, and reſtoring of any comfort wee have been deprived of; ſometimes juſtly, and ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly; whatſoever our condition be, if in all our diſtreſſes we can looke up unto him, and our hearts waite for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wholly from him. This argues, that we have him for our Saviour, becauſe we have ſuch reſpect unto him, and elſewhere we looke not, though we may uſe lawfull means, yet our eyes are not upon the meanes, but we looke a great
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117852:43"/>deal further, &amp; no further expect deliverance from any means then we ſee the Holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the God of our ſalvation, expreſſing and revealing himſelfe in the meanes. And to adde this one inſtance more of <hi>Ionah,</hi> Chap. 4. one that went away from God, and was unwilling to be directed by God, and therefore he was over-whelmed in the Sea, becauſe he would not be ruled, and bowed to the will of the Lord Jeſus, and therefore God ſent forth the moſt unruly Creature that God hath, ſet aſide the Devils in Hell, and it may be they have a hand in it too, in raiſing the horrible tempeſt that raged againſt them; and when <hi>Ionah</hi> was caſt out, the moſt unruly Creature, a Whale, meets with this unruly Prophet of God, and ſwallowed him up, that he thought himſelfe in <hi>the belly of Hell.</hi> Now when God had in ſome meaſure broken his heart, and in the Whales belly begins to conſider how unrulily he had dealt with God, and ſaid, Chap. 4. he ſaid, <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight, yet will I looke againe towards thy holy temple;</hi> Implying, that though he had been moſt unruly, and of a good man, the moſt of all you read of; yet when he ſaw God for his unrulineſſe meet him with ſuch affictions, yet when he ſaid, he was <hi>cast out of his ſight:</hi> yet, <hi>I will looke again towards thy holy temple.</hi> How could he tell which way the Temple ſtood when he was in the Whales belly? yet his heart was towards the Temple, which was a type of Chriſt; he in his heart had reſpect to the place where the Temple ſtood, and therein he ſhewed his reſpect to Chriſt, and ſo having reſpect unto him, he had him as his Saviour, moſt unruly <hi>Ionah;</hi> yet he having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt as his Saviour, he is delivered and ſaved; ſo that you ſee, he that hath Chriſt as a Sonne, he hath him as a Saviour; aad thoſe that have him for a Saviour, they waite on him, and only look for ſalvation from him.</p>
            <p>There is a ſecond duty for every man to performe, that hath Chriſt for his Saviour, and that is, he doth not only looke for ſalvation from him, when he ſtands in need of it, as we daily doe; for, <hi>Salvation is deliverance out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and preſervation in a good eſtate,</hi> and he lookes for all ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. laſt. Salvation belongs to God,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117852:43"/>and though many means may be uſed, yet it is the Lord and his mercy, and bleſſing, that ſaves and delivers, and nothing elſe, and Gods ſervants they know it.</p>
            <p>But there is a ſecond duty in having Chriſt for a Saviour; and that is, in <hi>looking up to Chriſt, and cleaving to him, and not only deſiring ſalvation from him, from all our diſtreſſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſt a Saviour from ſin as well as from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.</note> 
               <hi>but ſalvation alſo from all our ſins;</hi> and he that hath Chriſt for a Saviour, he from would be ſaved from all his ſins, as well as from all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>God hath appointed him a Prince, and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes;</hi> there is therefore this ſalvation to be had in Chriſt, not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of the hands of dangers, but from the hands of all our ſins and rebellions, and to be ſaved from them, by turning from them, and repenting of them; and we deſire not only forgiveneſſe of them, but ſalvation from them, to be ſaved from our ſtubborne ſpirits, and ſaved out of our covetouſneſſe, and wantonneſſe, and worldlineſſe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vanity of heart and life that we are ſubject to; to be ſaved from the vaine faſhions, and in all theſe we looke for ſalvation from Chriſt; we deſire to be ſaved not only from all our diſtreſſes, but eſpecially from the ſinfull diſtempers of our ſoules. It is a notable Pſalme, the 130.1. <hi>If thou Lord ſhould marke iniquity, who ſhould stand? but there is forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with thee that thou mayeſt be feared. I waite for the Lord, my ſoule doth wait, and in his word doe I hope; My ſoule waiteth for the Lord, more then they that watch for the morning. Let Iſrael waite for the Lord, for with him is mercy and plenteous redemption, and he ſhall redeeme Iſrael from all his iniquities,</hi> ver. 7, 8. and he is therefore called, <hi>Ieſus,</hi> Matth. 1.21. And notable is that expreſſion, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away all our iniquities, and receive us graciouſly, ſo will we give thee thankes.</hi> Thus they deſire ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from all their iniquities, and not ſo much ſalvation in the pardon of all their iniquities, for there is more in it then forgiveneſſe of ſinne, but a turning them from them; they deſire both <hi>pardoning,</hi> and <hi>healing,</hi> and God ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them, as appeares by verſ. 4. God anſwers them, That he would pardon them, and <hi>heale them;</hi> he wil remove them all away from them, not an hoofe be left behind, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117852:44"/>all taken away. There is a generation of men that are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous unwilling to yeeld to this, ſo that you ſee it is an ordinary thing for men to ſay, they have Chriſt for a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but it is a rare thing to be ſo indeed; you know how affectionate our Saviours ſpeech is, <hi>Matth,</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Ieruſalem, how often would I have gathered thee under my wing</hi> of ſalvation, <hi>but y u would not</hi> be gathered? The body of the Church of God, though ſome was gathered, yet others of them would not be gathered; and if it was thus with Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, it is no wonder if you read the like of Babilon, <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.9. <hi>We would have healed Babel, but ſhe would not be healed.</hi> God ſent his Church, and kept it there ſeventy yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that ſome of them at leaſt might imbrace the ſalvation of God, but ſhe would not be healed; we have uſed the beſt meanes we could to heale her, but it wil not be, ſhe wil not be healed of us, and therefore let us be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home againe. God would not ſend his Church among them for nothing, but he lookes for ſome fruits among them, but ſince either none were gathered, or ſo few, as that they were not a conſiderable number, therefore God will ſend his people home againe, when they ſay, <hi>Let us breake their bonds aſunder, and caſt their cords from us;</hi> then God will take no further paines, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3. It is a notable place that in <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.25. God cals upon his people moſt affectionately that they would be healed, but they <hi>ſnuffe up their iniquities as the wind, and like unto wilde Aſſe colts,</hi> would be at liberty, and take pleaſure in their running at random; and God ſaid, <hi>With-hold thy foot from being unſhod, and thy throat from thirſting after ſuch vanities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An hard matter to be willing to be ſaved by Chriſt.</note> 
               <hi>but thou ſayeſt</hi> deſperately, <hi>There is no hope, I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I goe.</hi> What a marvellous ſpeech is this in Gods own Servants, when God would with-hold them from running for ſalvation elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and from ſuch other ſins as they thirſted after; no, there is no hope but the courſe they had taken they would take, and no meanes ſhould ſave or draw them from their haunts; ſo that you ſee it is no eaſie matter for a man to be willing to be ſaved by Chriſt, and though many would be ſaved by him, yet few there be that would looke for all ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117852:44"/>from Chriſt, and are not willing to be ſaved from all their ſins, but are willing to keep ſome ſins ſtill alive in their ſoules; Are they not ready in their hearts to ſay as they ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> It was when Chriſt came to ſave two men from the poſſeſſion of a Legion of Devils, the men ſpoke it, though the Devils acted it in them; ſo when Chriſt comes to bring ſalvation, it is a torment to our ſoules; the <hi>two witneſſes vexed</hi> men, and they came but to ſave men; it is a torment to men to have ſinne pulled out of their ſoules, as you read, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.19. When the Apoſtles had caſt out of the maide the ſpirit of Divination, when their Maſters ſaw that the <hi>hope of their gaine was gone,</hi> they were in a rage, and cauſed them to be ſtoned, and left them for dead; now when men take it ill that they ſhould be ſaved, or are loath that their children, or ſervants ſhould be ſaved, take it ill that they dare no more lye and ſweare, and couzen, and buy and ſell on the Sabbath day, and ſuch and ſuch a gaine is thereby loſt, and this they cannot endure; it is a dangerous ſigne of an ill heart, and therefore however it is an uſuall ſaying, that every man wil have Chriſt for a Saviour; and yet if in truth we conſider it, I aſſure you in plaine English, we wil not be ſaved; that is our reſolution when it comes to the point.</p>
            <p>It is an uſe of Triall that we are upon in this Diſcourſe, and therefore to proceed to the next part of the point; thoſe that have Chriſt for a Saviour, they have him aſo for a Prince, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>God hath appointed him for a Prince,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth as a Prince.</note> 
               <hi>and a Saviour;</hi> If you wil have him for a Saviour, you muſt have him for a Prince; reſigne up your ſelves, you and yours, to be guided and governed by the Lord Jeſus, though you have never ſo many ſtrong oppoſitions, yet it muſt be ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Childe is given, unto us a Sonne is borne;</hi> How ſhall I know that Chriſt is borne for me, and this Son is given to me?

            <p>Firſt, when you reſign up your ſelves, to be wholly ruled by him in all your paths, ſo as that you leane not to your ſelves not ſo much as in one thought, but all your thoughts ſtand in ſubjection to his will, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God to caſt downe every high imagination, and to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> God leaves us not one thought free, nor are we willing to have our thoughts free, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.15. <hi>The thoughts of the righteous are right;</hi> that is, they come from a right rule, the Word of God, and aime at a right end, the glory of God; not a man that hath his part in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus but his thoughts are right.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true that you object, for <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. It is a complaint, and an earneſt ſpeech; <hi>O Ieruſalem, waſh thy heart from thy wickedneſſe that thou mayeſt be ſaved, how long ſhall thy vaine thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> So that you ſee a man that would have ſalvation by Chriſt, he muſt be content to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all his thoughts to Chriſt, and not leave one vaine thought to lodge within him. It is true, Sathan may cauſe them to flutter in his mind,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but he muſt give them no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; it is one thing to have a ſturdy Begger that comes to the doore, to ruſh into my houſe before I be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and enforce; and another thing to bid him welcome, and to bid him ſtay and lodge there all night, and to make proviſion for him; ſo it may be there is many a proud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious

It is true indeed, there is no Chriſtian man but he wil have vaine thoughts come in upon him, but you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this difference.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a man that hath not Chriſt for his Prince,<note place="margin">Chriſtians differenced by their thoughts.</note> he hath not one good thought comes in his minde, or if it doe, he doth not give it lodging there; all, or <hi>every imagination of his heart is evil, and that continually;</hi> the Originall is <hi>(Omne figmentum) the whole frame of a mans heart;</hi> the bent and ſcope of his thoughts, the whole ſuggeſtion of them firſt and laſt, not a good thought comes in him. Many a man wil ſay, it is very fitting, and meet it ſhould be ſo, that one day wee ſhould turne home to God, but not to give entertainment to him at this time, but let him come another time, and then he ſhall have lodging; and ſo we deale with all good thoughts, that God ſuggeſts into our hearts; we like good thoughts well, and ſometimes we are loath to give them offence, but yet are not willing to give them entertainment, but are more willing to be ſhut of them, and to turn them out of doores; but a godly man, if a good motion come into him, it is moſt welcome to his ſoule, and he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it with the gladneſſe of his ſpirit; he ſees it is of God his heavenly Father, and he lodges it in his heart, and conſcience, and affection, and rejoyces in it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after it, and cheriſheth it, and is loath to part
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:117852:46"/>with ſuch thoughts when he is gotten into ſuch a good frame.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay therefore, this is a difference; a carnall man never gives entertainment to a good thought, nor doe his thoughts ever aime at good ends, they never goe higher then himſelfe, and therefore never could good thought finde lodging in him; out againe it is thruſt, ſometimes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what courteouſly, ſometimes diſcourteouſly, but however there it muſt not lodge, there is a world of matter to quench and damp it, and to uſe meanes to be ſhut of it; but it is not ſo with a true Chriſtian, he entertaines Chriſt as his Prince, and he wil have every thought in him to be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; if a wicked thought come into a carnall mans heart it is naturall to him, it takes place, and is ſuffered to lodge there, anger reſts with him all night, and <hi>he ſuffers the Sunne to goe downe upon his wrath,</hi> Epheſians 4.26, 27. The Devill lodges there, and there hee may reſt, and he never takes paines to be cleanſed of thoſe evill thoughts, and he cares not how long they are there. But if a godly man have a wicked thought come upon him, he ſtirres up all the faculties of his ſoule, and the graces of the Spirit againſt it, and doth what he can to expell and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, and if he cannot prevaile, then he wil call for aide from his Prince, from Heaven, and wil acquaint his deare Chriſtian friends with it, and ſay; I am troubled with ſuch thoughts of malice, and pride, and vanity, that I know not in the world what to doe, they lye downe with me, and they riſe up with me, and therefore intreat their help; and as they looke to Chriſtian friends, ſo wil they eſpecially call to the <hi>Prince of their ſalvation,</hi> to ſave them from their vaine thoughts, and much more from theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpeeches, from theſe things they are moſt carefull to be delivered; and therefore they ſtand not deviſing Plots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Prince, but he wil tell him, that ſuch wicked rebellious thoughts deviſe miſchiefe againſt him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he craves helpe againſt them; ſo did <hi>David</hi> in the like caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.33. <hi>Search me, and know my heart, and ſee if there be any way of wickedneſſe in me.</hi> As if he had ſent to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117852:46"/>for a privy ſearch, he would not have any one thought within him, but he would that God ſhould know it, and therefore deſires, that God would try and ſearch, and know his thoughts; he was not like them of whom you read, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29.15. <hi>That digge deepe to hide their counſells from the Lord:</hi> but a child of God, would have God to be well acquainted with his thoughts; <hi>ſee if there be any way of wickedneſſe in me,</hi> any wicked thought or vain affection in my heart, I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find, and to caſt them out what I can, but there may be many more that I know not, <hi>but ſearch and try thou me, and lead me in the way that I ſhall goe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good thoughts are of everlaſting uſe,<note place="margin">Good thoughts continue ever.</note> and of everlaſting durance, and they will continue to everlaſting life, Gods wayes are everlaſting wayes, <hi>lead mee in the way everlaſting,</hi> thus a man hath every thought brought into ſubjection, though evill thoughts may come ruſhing in, yet he will not give them entertainment but complaines of them to Chriſt, and ſuch a man hath the Lord Jeſus for his Prince; for hee is not a Prince that onely Governs the outward man, as earthly Princes do, who can take no hold of what we think, but God takes notice of our thoughts.</p>
            <p>And you may apply what I ſay of thoughts, to words and actions, and ſo make uſe of it to all.</p>
            <p>There be many men, that never think good thought, but lets wicked thoughts reſt in them, can be wanton and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what ever it be that makes a thorow-fare in the heart, let it there lodge, let it come and go as it will, and that is part of the meaning of the high-way-ſide ground, it keeps, and is, a thorow-fare to all beaſts, to all ſorts of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailers, to Theeves and Robbers, takes no notice of them, lets them come and goe and ſtay as they liſt, then we have not Chriſt for our Governour, we do not put the Government of our thoughts, and actions upon his ſhoulders, and are not in ſubjection to him, <hi>but caſts his cords from us, Pſalm.</hi> 2.3. and ſay <hi>we will not have this man to reigne over us, Lu.</hi> 19.22. what, is not our thoughts free? and are not our tongues our owne? <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 12.4. <hi>David</hi> takes them for Atheiſts that ſay, <hi>their tongues are their owne;</hi> He prayes that God would <hi>keepe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117852:47"/>his lips, Pſalm.</hi> 119. onely Gods people would have all that is in them bowed to the obedience of Gods will: Some men there be that will not have God to rule over them, ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous is the prophainneſſe of our hearts while we are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that we that ſhould be ſervants to God, we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to make him a Servant to us, we were never ſubjet to any man, nor doe we mean ſo to bee <hi>Pharoah</hi>-like. Who is the Lord? I know not who he is. Notable is that you read, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.34 beſides that, I had no ſervice from you, <hi>thou haſt made me to ſerve, with, or under thy ſins;</hi> ſee the deſperate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the hearts of the ſinful ſons of men, they draw in God to ſerve them, and he complains, that he is preſſed under their ſins, <hi>as a Cart is preſſed under ſheaves:</hi> men load the patience of God, and lay upon him, one bundell of wickedneſſe after another; they lay ſo much wickedneſſe upon him, till the patience of God will beare no longer, as long as ever hee will beare, and ſuffer us to live in this world, we will load him with ſheaves upon ſheaves, load the very majeſty of God, and his long ſufferance, and make uſe of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence many times to ſerve our owne luſts, we will do that which is wicked in Godsſight, becauſe we can doe it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath given us means to do it; we can maintain our pride and covetouſneſſe, and God gives us theſe gifts, and theſe liberties, and we will make God to ſerve with them, and here is a double ſervice put upon God.</p>
            <p>Firſt we load his patience, and forbearance, by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in ſin; but beſides that, we abuſe the very gifts of God, as our wealth, and good parts of nature, and our common graces: And (by your leave) the very ſaving graces of Gods ſpirit, wee will not ſtick to abuſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; And is not this much rebellion, that we ſhould make God to ſerve ſuch a weariſome ſervice, he is provoked every day, and weary to ſuffer us in a ſinfull courſe one day to an end; but when day after day, and year after yeare we lay load upon Gods patience: and if he will ſuffer us long ſo he may; and if we do ſet God at liberty from his drudgery, it muſt be at the laſt gaſpe, and he ſhall be our Ruler then, if hee will. Wonder not therefore if
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117852:47"/>ſometime God ſay, <hi>Rebellion is as the ſinne of witch-craft,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. And that is in a double reſpect.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As you ſee a Witch gives her ſoule to the Devill, that ſhe may have her mind fulfilled for her life time; ſo a Rebell deales with the devill, to have his owne luſts ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, he makes a Covenant with Hell and with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, he is at an agreement, he knowes he doth wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to ſerve his owne turne, hee is content to doe it.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, As a Witch will have the Devill to wait upon her, ſo at laſt ſhe will wait upon the Devill, ſo it is in this caſe: The Devill muſt ſerve a Witch all her life time, and ſhe will ſerve the Devill at her death: Far more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous, is this wickedneſſe in this kind, we will have God to ſerve us all our life time, and when death comes, wee will doe God this favour, wee will ſerve him then: As a Witch deales with the Devill, ſo do we with God, he ſhal ſupply our occaſions, and we will make uſe of his bounty to ſerve our ſelves, but at laſt gaſpe God ſhall rule us, to doe him all the ſervice we can, and give him all good words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is great and plenteous mercy to be found in him, and now we will doe him all the honour we can. And will God bee thus ſerved, think you? doe you thinke to put him off, as Witches put off the Devill, will he (think you) take your ſervice then? Conſider of it, This is to make God our Prince, when wee give up our ſelves to ſerve him.</p>
            <p>There is a ſecond thing, wherein the having of Chriſt for a Prince doth ſtand: And it requires, that you doe all your ſervice to him, as to a Prince, it ſhould all be Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſervice, ſuch as becomes a Prince, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>When you bring that which is torne or lame, offer it to your Prince, and ſee if hee will accept it.</hi> Implying, that God is a Prince, and if a Prince, then where is his Princely ſervice, if you wil ſerve him, ſerve him of the beſt of that you have: God looks for no more but what you have; but when you come and offer him a lame &amp; peremptory Sacrifice, and be loath to come off with the fat and ſtrength of your affections, and are loath to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:117852:48"/>your deareſt luſts, then you deal not with God, as with a Prince, you offer him ſuch a Sacrifice as is loathſome to him: God curſes ſuch <hi>Deceivers who have in their flock a male, and ſacrifice unto the Lord a corrupt thing. For I am a great King ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts;</hi> to pretend him to be a Prince, and yet to ſerve him like a Peaſant, this God curſes; God accepts <hi>Abells</hi> Sacrifice, becauſe he brought the fatteſt and beſt of the flock to ſacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. When we bring the ſtrength of our hearts, the fat of our ſtrength, this God accepts, and then wee offer to him as to a Prince.</p>
            <p>Notable was that ſpeech of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.24. <hi>I will not offer to God, a Sacrifice of that which will coſt me nothing.</hi> A man offered royally to the King; <hi>I give them all freely to thee; As a King, he gave to the King:</hi> If a man give to a King, he muſt give of the beſt he hath, <hi>behold all are thine.</hi> And as if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſhould ſay; If you will be ſo bountifull to mee, ſhall not I much more that am a King, give like a King, to the King of Kings? We muſt give our beſt ſtrength, the beſt we have of any thing to God. <hi>I and my houſhold will ſerve the Lord, Joſh.</hi> 24.15, All is little enough to give to God; make it a point of our ſervice in our beſt duties, this God lookes for, we ſhould do it the beſt we can; If we would have him for a Prince, and as to a Prince, we ſhould freely part with all.</p>
            <p>And therefore to conclude this point, know, that this point is the principall ſumme of the Goſpell, and this duty is of great neceſſity; And let us therefore ſumme it up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Sum of all</note> and lay it to our owne hearts: You would know whether you have life or no; if you have life, you have Chriſt. How will you know that? Aske then your hearts this queſtion; Hath God exalted Chriſt to be a Prince, and a Saviour to you? Conſider, if you have Chriſt for a Saviour and a Prince, And if you ſo have him, then you have the Son; and if you have the Son, you have life: And therefore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon this ſeriouſly, do you find your hearts looking to Chriſt for ſalvation, in whatſoever diſtreſſes you are in? Some will ſay I am in diſtreſſe, and anguiſh of ſoule, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe in my ſpirit and troubled with fear of Gods wrath,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117852:48"/>and ſence of the torment of Hel. Another man ſaith, I am in diſtreſſe through bodily weakneſſe, and ſickneſſe; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayes, I am in diſtreſſe through great poverty; another in debts; another is in diſtreſſe through the great unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of Wife, and Children, and Servants, theſe be deep and great diſtreſſes; yet conſider, Chriſt is a Saviour, from all diſtreſſes, God hath not limited his ſalvation to this, and that, but it reaches all the evils we are ſubject to; then whether doth thy heart looke, and upon whom doeſt thou waite for ſalvation? If thy heart tell thee, that in the midſt of all theſe deſertions thou lookeſt for ſalvation from the <hi>Lord Ieſus,</hi> and thine eyes are unto him, and thou doeſt finde thy ſpirit willing to waite for ſalvation from him; then thou haſt him for thy Saviour, and he wil ſave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thee from them all, and it is an evident argument we have him for a Saviour.</p>
            <p>But if in our dangers and diſtreſſes we looke to this and that meanes, and to this and that friend, and ſometimes put our ſelves to flight from Peſtilence, and Famine (though in ſome caſes we lawfully may) if thou doeſt only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lawfull meanes, and uſeſt them according to Gods wil, and for Gods honour, then thou waiteſt upon God for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, elſe not; If thou lookeſt to him which <hi>hideth his face from the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> if God hide his face from Church and Common-wealth, and yet <hi>our eyes are towards him,</hi> and we <hi>know not what to doe,</hi> for our Conſciences, and Liberty, and Eſtates, and health, and peace, &amp;c. But our eyes are unto Chriſt, ſuch a looke at Chriſt is a ſaving and healing looke; and as they were ſaved and healed by looking at the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> Numb. 21.9. ſo truly the Son of Man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, that whoſoever lookes for ſalvation from him ſhould receive it, though they be not yet come to the full perſwaſion that the Lord is their God, as they ſhall in time come to; but if they looke with a wiſt ſad looke at him, and reſt not ſatisfied till ſalvation come, this makes him their Saviour; <hi>Looke unto me, and be ye ſaved.</hi> But if we look to friends, and meanes, and our owne hands, and doings, then no hope of ſalvation from him.</p>

            <p> There is this difference between the Cony and the Hare, the Cony is a thing not ſtrong, yet reckoned among the wiſe people; when they heare the noyſe of a Dogge, they run to their rock and ſhrowd themſelves, and ſo are ſafe; whereas the wilde Hare hath no helpe but her heels, ſhee runs through Fields and paſtures, runs every way, but hath no protection, but her heeles, and is of all Creatures moſt deſtitute: So if we run to the Lord Jeſus for deliverance from all our evils, he wil ſpread a wing of preſervation over us; but if we run to any Creature we can have no reſt, nor peace, and then it argues we have no Chriſt, becauſe no Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and no Saviour, becauſe we look not to him. And if you looke to him to ſave you from your miſeries, and not from your ſins, you have him not as a Saviour; you would be excuſed in this and that, ſpare me but here only; <hi>Faelix</hi> would be ſpared in his <hi>Dalilah,</hi> but if you would be ſpared, in any ſinne excuſed for, nor parting with any iniquity, then you have not Chriſt for your Saviour; remember what our Saviour ſaid to the man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Wouldeſt thou be made whole?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Yea Lord,</hi> and he was healed. So this is the point, Wilt thou be made whole? If God ſo far turne the ſtreame of our hearts, that unfainedly we would be made whole, not a member in our bodies but we would have it healed; we would not have an uncleane luſt in our ſoules, but we would be perfectly made whole; would we be ſaved from all our ſins? then we have him for our Saviour; and there is not a ſin in us but we ſhall be healed of it, and this is life, to looke to Chriſt for univerſall ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And ſo conſider, have you Chriſt for a Prince? Are your hearts willing to ſubject every thought unto him? you ſay, you are ſomewhat unwilling to it, but doth not the Apoſtle ſay; <hi>Every thought muſt be brought into ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt, into captivity;</hi> and were it not better to be free, and voluntary. It is true, Gods people know that when they were firſt brought on to God, they were carried captive, and drawne, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44. but afterwards they finde the ſervice of Chriſt to be perfect freedome, and therefore how lookeſt thou at thy thoughts, for I principally take notice of them.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:117852:49"/>Art thou not willing that a vaine thought ſhould lodge within thee? thoughts of pride, and of revenge come into thy heart, but what entertainment doſt thou give them? Doth Satan when he comes finde thy houſe fit for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? If thou give theſe Gueſts ſuch entertainment, then thou haſt not Chriſt for thy Prince, but if they come like ſtubborne Rebels into thy houſe, and they diſturbe thee, and thou call to thy friends to help thee, and thou cryeſt out to thy Prince in Heaven for a privie ſearch to be made, to finde them out, and would not have any one wicked thought to reſt in thy heart, then thou haſt Chriſt for thy Prince, but if thou giveſt them willing entertainment, and lodgeſt them next thy heart, and fatteſt and feedeſt thy ſelfe in ſuch thoughts of wrath, and luſt, and huggs them in thy boſome, then thy heart ſtands in rebellion againſt God; if theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious luſts be thy friendly companions, then God is not at peace with thee; but if thou beeſt burthened with them, as Souldiers come into the houſes of men that live in the Palatinate, and they are forced to entertaine them, but if thou wouldeſt caſt them out, then thou haſt Chriſt for thy Prince; but if you refuſe his government, and your thoughts are your owne, and you wil have God to ſerve your turne, and you burthen his patience with one wicked courſe after another, and you make uſe of Gods patience to the ſinfull provocation of his wrath; and you deale with God as Witches doe with the Devil, he ſhall ſerve you now, and you will ſerve him when you dye. Conſider what ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice you offer to God, any thing is good enough for God, and the wayes of his grace is a burthen to you, then you have him not for your Prince. Now in the name and fear of God, conſider what hath been ſaid, every one take his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>and the Lord give you a good underſtanding in all things.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E now come to a third head of Signes, by which it may appeare whether we have Chriſt or no, and that is from the third word in the Text (which is <hi>Life</hi>) for it is an Argument of like ſtrength and value, to argue the one from the other. <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life, and he that hath life, he hath the Sonne;</hi> and therefore now at this time to open to you ſome ſignes, or markes by which it may appear to us whether we have life, or no; that Spirituall Life here ſpoken of: to wit, the life of righteouſneſſe in our Juſtification, and of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of comfort and conſolation, and of eternall glory.</p>
            <p>And the ſignes of Life are of three ſorts;<note place="margin">Three ſorts of ſignes of Spirituall life.</note> either you may diſcerne the life of Gods Grace by the cauſes of it, or by the effects of it; or by the qualities and properties of it, as we call them.</p>
            <p>Firſt;<note place="margin">1 Signe.</note> for the Cauſes, the Holy Ghoſt uſually ſets forth the cauſes of our Spirituall life, and if we finde theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to have been the work of that life, which we conceive our ſoules to be endued with, we may from thence argue the truth of our Spirituall life, and from thence the truth of our fellowſhip with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For the firſt;<note place="margin">Firſt cauſe of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life.</note> The firſt cause of our Spirituall life, is the holy and gracious will of God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his owne will begat he us;</hi> It is that therefore to this life by which we are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:117852:50"/>begotten, for all generation is unto life, it is of his own wil that we are begotten to this life.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſets it forth,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.13. opend.</note> by the removeall and deniall of all other cauſes, <hi>John</hi> 1.13. <hi>We are borne not of fleſh nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God: Not of bloods.</hi> Not of godly parents; for men may have godly Parents, and yet themſelves degenerate, and therefore it is not to be aſcribed to parentage, it is not from the parentage, but from the Covenant, and from Gods will in the Covenant, that begets a child of God, nor is it of <hi>the will of the fleſh;</hi> that is, of corrupt nature, nor of the will of man, nor of the beſt paines that they can take, though they take much paines for us, yet all may be in vaine, ſo as that unleſſe God ſet in with Chriſtian friends, and with the blood and Covenant of our Anceſtors, we ſhall not be brought on to live a ſpirituall life in Gods ſight. It is that which God himſelfe ſpeakes of in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6. <hi>When wee were yet in our blood, yet God ſaid to us live.</hi> When we were in our blood, like an infant, gaſpeing for naturall life, and ready to periſh, even then when none could helpe us, <hi>then God ſaid to us live,</hi> and then we lived in his ſight. And therefore in a word, you may take this for an evident ſigne of the true life of grace, where ever you find the worke of grace wrought in any ſoule, you ſhall find the heart ſpeaking of it, as the worke of Gods owne hand. Take you a man in the eſtate of nature, and he will ſay, God be thanked he had alwayes a good mind, and his parents would never ſay no leſſe of him, but he was alwayes a toward and hopefull child he thanks God; and thus a man will ſpeake that is onely well nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he will ſay, it is a worke that was ever in him, and he ever thought ſo of himſelfe: But now take another man, that is indeed borne to a new life, and hath this life in him that ſprings from Chriſt, he will tell you as <hi>Paul</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>When it pleaſed God to ſeparate me from my mothers wombe, and called me by his grace.</hi> There you ſhal as in a pattern diſcern what the maner of the expreſſion of a living ſoul is, he doth not ſay it was wrought when he had a good mind to hear ſuch a man, or to take ſuch a courſe, ſo it may be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:117852:51"/>will fleſh and blood ſay, but when you come to an heart that indeed lives in God ſight, he expreſſeth himſelf thus: <hi>but when it pleaſed God it was done.</hi> I for my part ran cleane another way, I never had a deſire after God, I had indeed a kind of forme and ſhew, and could comply my ſelfe to my Governours and Neighbours; that I might be flattered and incouraged by them, and I ſhould never have taken better courſe of my ſelfe; <hi>but when it pleaſed God to call me by his grace,</hi> there is the life of a Chriſtian, he fetches his life from the higheſt heavens; <hi>It pleaſed God to call me by his grace, and to reveale his Sonne in me;</hi> when it pleaſed him to ſhew me the eſtate of my ſoule, and the ſinfull rebellion of my heart and when he revealed Chriſt, not ſo much <hi>to me,</hi> as <hi>in me,</hi> he was revealed to him, in <hi>Act.</hi> 9. in the firſt viſion and worke upon him; but when he <hi>revealed Chriſt in me,</hi> then he went that way the Holy ghoſt led him. Thus you ſhal eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerne it plainly; though it be hidden in the pleaſure of God, yet it will ſhew it ſelfe evidently in the expreſſion of a Chriſtian man, when he comes to ſpeake of the life of his ſpirituall eſtate, they never attribute it to good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, nor to the good inſtructions of others, but they ſay, when it pleaſed God, thus and thus to reveal himſelf in me, when he ſhewed me my ſelfe, when God laid about to find which way to hemme me in, then it pleaſed God to do it, and ſince then I have lived.</p>
            <p>A ſecond cauſe of my ſpiritual life is,<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life.</note> The Word of God; the word of Promiſe, for ſo the Apoſtle tells you; <hi>Not all that are of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are the ſeed and children of</hi> Abraham; <hi>but the children of the Promiſe, are counted for the ſpirituall ſeed:</hi> That ſeed which is elected of God, and choſen to everlaſting life, that is the <hi>ſeed of Promiſe:</hi> That is, ſuch as are begotten of ſome promiſe of God or other, <hi>Every</hi> Iſaack <hi>is a Sonne of the promiſe.</hi> And leaſt you ſhould thinke it peculiar to <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi> alone, the Apoſtle opens it ſweetly, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28. As a thing common with <hi>Iſaack</hi> to all the people of God; it is a like Priviledge given to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and to all others that were born of God: <hi>We brethren are children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> it was not peculiar to <hi>Iſaack</hi> alone to be borne of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117852:51"/>Promiſe, and yet of the Promiſe he was borne, in a kind of peculiar manner; for before he was born, God gave <hi>Iſaack</hi> to <hi>Sarah</hi> by promiſe, and by vertue of that promiſe was he borne, even a naturall life: Now ſo farre indeed it was a ſpeciall peculiar Prerogative to <hi>Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would from thence gather; that the ſpiritual <hi>birth of us all, is by a word of promiſe;</hi> All of us, one and other is born, by a word of Providence, but if we ſpeak of our ſpiritual birth, then <hi>we brethren are children of the Promiſe.</hi> So that you ſhall obſerve this to be an holy truth of God; That every child of God, is borne of the promiſe of God: So that then haſt thou a new birth, and doſt thou live a new life. Tel me then, what promiſe was it that did beget thee to God, that begat thee to this new life? What Word of God was it, by which thou waſt begotten? it is a general ſpeech, that in <hi>Ro.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing,</hi> and by the doctrine of faith preached, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.5. that is, <hi>the Goſpell of faith;</hi> ſo that this is the point: There is ſome promiſe which being reported to the ſoule in the miniſtery of the Word, is laid hold upon by the hearts of Gods people, the ſame Word of promiſe, working that faith in the heart, by which the ſoule cleaves to ſuch a promiſe. Then doe but conſider, if thou beeſt borne of God, what cauſe was there of thy birth? waſt thou born of that Word of God, or of thine own conceite, or of the good opinion of Chriſtians? or is there ſome Word of God, which thou haſt placed thy confidence in, and upon which thou haſt been reformed; and ſince that day to this, God hath turned thy heart and way to another courſe, and given thee to live in his ſight? It is true, it may be many a good ſoule cannot readily tell you,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> what promiſe did firſt bring them on to God; but though thou canſt not alwayes tell, yet a word of promiſe it was; and ordinarily, a word of Promiſe which the word preached did apply to thy ſoule, and cauſed thy heart to reach forth and to lay hold upon it; but though thou beeſt not always able to reckon up the firſt Promiſes, yet this I ſay: And marke it, there is no Chriſtian ſoule, but hath ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God on which his heart is ſtayed upon, and by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:117852:52"/>which his life is nouriſhed, which argues it was bred of thoſe promiſes, of which it is now fed, though a man be not alwayes able to tell what promiſe it was; ſometimes a word of reproofe or of counſell, may ſink deep into a man, when God ſets it wel on; and may make a deep impreſſion in the heart of a man; And may ſo turne about the courſe of their lives, as that thereby they may reforme all common and outward, and knowne ſoule ſinnes, which before was ever cauſe and matter of reproofe, but that is not ſo ſafe a worke of Chriſt, not ſuch a ſtrong evidence of our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life, when ſuch a word of reproofe or counſell hath ſet us in ſuch a courſe, and we have thereupon refrained ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and breaking of the Sabbath, and vain faſhions; this is well, but it is not ſo ſafe a ſigne of our new birth; for this may befal even an hypocrite, he may be ſo convinced by a word of grace, and wiſe counſell, as may ſtrongly turne the ſtreame of his courſe another way; and yet bee without any life and power of godlineſſe, only the word of promiſe is able to work grace, and life in the heart of a man.</p>
            <p>For the Ground of the Point is this,<note place="margin">Ground of the point.</note> we cannot have a ſpirit of life wrought in us by the workes of the Law, nor by the words of the Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.5. <hi>He that miniſtereth to you in the ſpirit, and worketh miracles, doth hee it by the workes of the Law?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, did ye ever receive the grace of Chriſt, by the workes of the Law? or by the counſell of the Law, or by the commandements of the Law? or by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes reached forth from the Law; he excludes it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and as no wayes able to doe it, verſ. 21. And therefore he doth ever lead us unto ſome word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to ſome promiſe of grace for the ground of all our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life; as if ever we would be able to ſay, we are begotten to a new Inheritance, we muſt be able, and are able to ſay, we have ſome word of Promiſe, which hath wrought this in our ſoules, which hath bowed us to looke to Chriſt, and to cleave to him for ſtrength, and increaſe, and groweth in grace.</p>
            <p>For it is true indeed, The Workes of the Law may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117852:52"/>cut us off from ſome bad wayes, but when it hath don ſo, it leaves us there; leaves us in an eſtate wherein we would not give offence, and would not diſpleaſe men, that are grave and wiſe; And this we may reach unto without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the glory of God, or any inward regard of his holy feare, but when as we are quickned to live by vertue of ſome Promiſe, then the <hi>love of God conſtraineth us</hi> to live to obedience and good ends, then our reſpects can reach hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual ends.</p>
            <p>And therefore obſerve this as of neceſſary uſe for any man; that as he would be loath to be deceived in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit peece of money; ſo much more let him be carefull in the main points of his everlaſting eſtate: on this depends our having or not having of life. And therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves us to bee ſure that we be not diſappointed in this great myſtery of godlineſſe, and conſider ſeriouſly upon what your hopes and confidence was bred, and whence it was grounded.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay; But is it not ordinary that the Word of the Law doth humble and caſt downe the heart and ſpirit before God, and cut them off from all confidence in the fleſh, before they come to lay hold of the promiſe of grace in Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, it is ſo indeed, That ordinarily, ſome word of the Law, ſome word of conviction prevailes with the heart, and makes him in ſence of ſinne, ſay to his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an friends, <hi>what ſhall I doe to be ſaved?</hi> this is true, but yet this is not it, that makes him a new man in Gods ſight, it may reach to the reformation of his outward man, and to the alteration of ſundry of his former courſes, which no meanes elſe could have reclaimed; but yet this makes him not live a ſpiritual life, until he be not onely humbled by the Law, but in ſome meaſure brought on, to look after the promiſe of grace in Chriſt, and to long after them, and to ſay, and deſire, oh that I had but my part in this or that promiſe, what a mercy of God would that be to me, could I but lay hold upon them, but thereupon the ſoule of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, doth ſtand poring and plodding, and wiſtly gazeing upon them, till in the end the very ſight of a promiſe, hath
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:117852:53"/>ſo ſeaſoned us with a ſpirit of faith, that we begin not only to long after that promiſe, but to cleave to it, and in time come to receive it into our hearts, and come to imbrace it, to rejoyce in it, to acknowledge it, and finde our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and life, and comfort to bee wrapped up in it.</p>
            <p>A third cauſe of our ſpiritual life,<note place="margin">A third cauſe of Spirituall life.</note> Is the Spirit of grace <hi>that which is borne of the ſpirit is ſpirit,</hi> whatever is <hi>borne of the fleſh</hi> and no more, is but carnall, but that which is <hi>borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit, Joh.</hi> 3.6. there is a <hi>ſhedding abroad,</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Gods grace in the heart of man, that makes him of another ſpirit, he is not the ſame man, that he was before his ſpirit was changed, his inclination and diſpoſition is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>For Spirit is nothing elſe but the <hi>inclination,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the habit of it;</hi> the ſpirit of wiſdome, is an habit or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Wiſdome; the Spirit of grace, is an habit of Grace; the Spirit of prayer, is an inclination or an habit of Prayer: they are ſeverall words, but all meane the ſame thing: <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mindes,</hi> that is, bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the inclination and diſpoſition of your minde, <hi>Epb.</hi> 4.23. And not only be renewed in the mind, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or underſtanding of a man; but there muſt be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newall of the whole ſoule of a man, the diſpoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the whole muſt be changed and altered. <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was <hi>of another ſpirit,</hi> they could judge of things otherwiſe then other men could doe, other men not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſpirit of their mind, have no alteration; but the truly regenerate they ſee a great change, they never ſaw the danger of their ſinnes before, nor ever before judged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their ſinnes, but now their ſpirit, and ſoule, and affection is changed, and now a ſpirit of feare, and love, and care, and every affection is altered; now a man is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned quite off from earthly things, ſo farre as they hinder him in the enjoyment of his Spirituall life, and now we are ſet upon the things of God, ſo as that he that is borne of God to a Spirituall life, is become <hi>a new Creature, and old things are past away,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. He hath a new mind, and a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:117852:53"/>new heart, new affections, new Language, and new em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments that he was never wont to doe before; now he can read Gods Word, and conferre with Gods people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of God, and can inſtruct others, and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe to a new mould, and all upon the renewall of the ſpirit of his minde; ſo that if you ſee that God hath put another ſpirit into you then ever you had before, ſo as not only this, or that part, but the whole man is changed, and put into another frame, that though there be ſtill a taſte of the Old man, yet the frame both of the body and ſoule is of another mould, <hi>and all things are become new</hi> in ſome meaſure; then you live a new life indeed, elſe it is not a perfect change, though this and that alteration bee wrought in you. By theſe cauſes you may clearly diſcerne whether God hath given you a new life or no; conſider it therefore I beſeech you, how doe you now finde your hearts apt to ſpeak, when you ſpeak of that eſtate you are in? Are you in your Cloſets wont to ſay, That time was when you have been thus and thus led, in the vanitie of your minde, and the hardneſſe of your heart, and cuſtome of ſinne, but when it pleaſed God, who called you by his grace, when it pleaſed God, then it tooke place; you had been in good company before, and had uſed many meanes, but never any thing would worke; but when it pleaſed God, then it wrought, and from that day to this it hath been ſo and ſo with me. It is a good ſigne to you, if withall you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, that ſuch or ſuch a <hi>word of promiſe</hi> it pleaſed God to pitch your ſoules upon, you have long looked and waited for ſalvation, but in the end it pleaſed God to wrap up your ſoules in life by ſuch a promiſe; and if you can call to minde that ſuch a promiſe your ſoules did cleave unto, then are you indeed borne to a Spirituall life, becauſe you are right bred, bred of a Promiſe, and of the holy will and pleaſure of God; but if you finde your ſelves to be of another frame, and you are bowed to walke with God, and to reforme your courſe of life by outward bounds, this is not ſo ſafe; but if your whole man univerſally be bowed to a godly holy frame, and all things are become new; new
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:117852:54"/>friends, new affections, new deſires, if you finde ſuch an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall change,</hi> then you are right bred Chriſtians, and indeed no Chriſtians are right bred but ſuch Chriſtians; but if you make a great ſtirre about the great Reformation that is wrought in you, and it is from the good inclination, and diſpoſition you have alwaies had; you ever had a good minde, and in the end (you thanke God) you have refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſuch and ſuch evils as you have been blamed for; time was when you could <hi>have freely played at Cards and Dice,</hi> but ſince then you ſee the vanity of it,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> and you take better courſes, and doe now conſort your ſelves with wel ordered and ſtayed company, you had alwaies a good minde to be better, but you could not doe it ſuddenly, and ſo in the concluſion your reformation is but a good inclination or diſpoſition of your minde; and if you ſee that much good hath been wrought upon you by the counſell of ſuch and ſuch friends, and by the good example of ſuch and ſuch wiſe and diſcreet friends; and if you find that there is ſome ſtrange change in your carriage, your courſe of life is much altered, you are not ſo light and wanton as you were; but you take a farre more grave, and wiſe, and ſtayed courſe, and to much better purpoſe both for Church and Common-wealth wherein you live; now I ſay, if you ſhall goe on, and looke for that Spirituall life, which only ſprings from Chriſt Jeſus, and wil lead on to eternall glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſts not in any reformation of your ſelves, till you finde there be ſuch an inward and whole change wrought in you, which the heart is wont to ſpeake of to the praiſe of Gods grace, it was Gods will, elſe it could never have been wrought, and you could not ſpeak of it till now; and you never reſt ſatisfied in ſuch a change, as a word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe or counſell, that hath wrought ſuch a change or reformation in you, that ſtayed in the outward man, or in ſome affections, till you found your hearts to ſanctifie the name of Gods grace in the acknowledgement of the word of Promiſe, and of the Spirit of grace, making you new, that you may bee able to ſay, that in very deed you have Chriſt, and with Chriſt life, and that life which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:117852:54"/>will never decay, but wil hold to all eternity.</p>
            <p>And therefore now to ſpeake ſomething of the ſignes of the life of our Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Therefore a ſecond ſort of ſignes,<note place="margin">Signes of ſpirituall life from the effects of it.</note> is taken from the effects of Spirituall life, you ſee what is the cauſes of it, as the good pleaſure of God, the word of promiſe, and the Spirit of grace, theſe be the firſt ſort of ſignes.</p>
            <p>Now a ſecond ſort of ſignes is from the effects and fruits of life, and herein take notice of ſome fruits of your life of Juſtification;<note place="margin">Life of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it is a principall part of our Spirituall life to have our ſins forgiven, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquity is pardoned, and to whom the Lord imputeth no ſinne,</hi> Pſal. 32.1, 2. And therefore it is, that forgiveneſſe of ſinne is called juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; then God accounts us righteous, and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Juſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5.18. becauſe in the pardon of our ſins is our life; As when a Malefactor by the Law is condemned, he is by the Law a dead man; and if his Pardon come, his pardon is his life, and it is ſo indeed: So is it in this caſe, the pardon of our ſins is the very life of our ſoules, and if God give us to finde that life, there is no feare of the life of our Sanctification, or Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The firſt effect then that flowes from the pardon of our ſins, is ſome inward peace of Conſcience,<note place="margin">Inward peace flowes from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſins.</note> ſome inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment and ſatisfaction yeelded to the heart, that it could never attaine to before, for ſinne may be pardoned in the ſight of God, and yet that pardon is not manifeſted and declared to my ſoule, untill God vouchſafe me ſome meaſure of peace, and a manifeſtation of the free pardon of my ſins, I can have little reſt; it is a notable ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1 <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> A man juſtified, is one that hath his ſins pardoned, for what was it that all our life time before made us afraid of Gods diſpleaſure, and we had much diſquietneſſe about our eſtates; Oh, the ſinne of our ſoules that we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all our life long, the ſinne committed many a day agoe, that now lay heavie upon our ſoules, and the want of pardon lay as heavie as our ſins; but now if God come
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:117852:55"/>and ſay, Thy ſins are pardoned, then followes a ſweete tranquility of peace in the ſoule. A matter that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have talked of, to quiet the minde, to lull men aſleep, and with applying remedies, did ſtupiſie for a while, and take off the heavie burthen, or the ſence of the burthen, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the burthen it ſelfe; but ſo ſoone as ever God pardons ſinne, there is ſhed abroad a ſpirit of peace in our ſoules, and ſometimes in that unſpeakable meaſure, as that it paſſeth the underſtanding of a man to conceive,<note place="margin">Note this</note> 
               <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. But I doe not ſo conceive, that every Chriſtian as ſoone as ever his ſinne is firſt pardoned, hath ſuch an unconceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peace in his ſoule; but he findes a great deale of eaſe ſometimes, as if you had thrown a Milſtone from off his body; notable is that expreſſion in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>The work of righteouſneſſe ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſſe quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and aſſurance for ever.</hi> He ſpeakes of that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereby we ſtand righteous before God, and the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to our ſoules. The worke of righteouſneſſe ſhall be peace; from this worke and effect you may gather what the cauſes of it is: bleſſed are ſuch, it is quietneſſe and aſſurance for ever. Not that there is an everlaſting ſence of that peace, for the ſence of it is ſometimes obſcured for want of watchfulneſſe, and want of experience in the wayes of godlineſſe; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through the buffetings of Sathan, or deſertions from the hand of God, and ſo many times our peace may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-clouded, and the ſence of it taken away, but <hi>the worke of righteouſneſſe is peace;</hi> if ſinne be pardoned, peace will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it, and the fruit of this righteouſneſſe <hi>is quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and aſſurance for ever;</hi> the heart is now peaceable, quiet, and aſſured that God hath wrought this and that grace in me, which will abide in me for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2<note place="margin">2. Effect.</note> That you may be further inſtructed in this point, ſee a ſecond effect of this life of juſtification, of the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, which is of ſpeciall uſe for the right diſcerning of our Spirituall life, and that is this; Looke as in all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, no man hath received life, but is carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give to ſave
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117852:55"/>his life;</hi> and if his life be ſtruck at, he will have his hand cut off rather then have his head wounded; he will expoſe himſelfe or any member to any danger, rather then looſe his life. And ſo if God vouchſafe pardon of ſinne, and peace of conſcience; you wil find this an evident ſigne of pardon and peace together, and an evident effect of them both; a ſerious care, and a conſtant endeavour to maintaine and keep that peace, that as you ſee God hath been very gracious in ſpeaking peace to you, ſo you would preſerve that peace above all the bleſſings in the world, that whatſoever you looſe elſe, though you looſe friends, and goods, and lands, and trades, health, and liberty, you would not looſe your peace, though you hazard the loſſe of them all to preſerve and maintaine your peace; that peace when it was given you, was ſo unſpeakable and glorious, that life it ſelfe was not to be compared to this mercy which God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed us, when he gave us peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is better then life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man that hath found ſomething that is better then his life, he will looſe his life rather then it, and much more any thing elſe; and therefore if you ſee God incline your hearts to be tender and chary of your peace, then God hath beſtowed peace and pardon upon you; and it is evident; becauſe you are ſo loath to breake it. A man that never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this peace, he makes no conſcience of ſinne, unleſſe it blemiſh him in the eye of the World; he makes no great matter of conſcience to run into any ſinne, becauſe the old ſcore is yet undiſcharged: Chriſt is not wont to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that ſcore which we make no conſcience to run into againe.</p>
            <p>And if they doe, he can tell how to make them feele the ſmart of playing ſuch Prodigalls, but when God hath blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all our ſins out of his ſight, that there is no more men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne between God and our ſouls, that the heart of a Chriſtian will be marvellous chary and ſolicitous, that it ſinne no more againſt God; he that hath his ſinne pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and knowes what it hath coſt, both on Gods part and on his own, he is very carefull of running into ſinne any
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117852:56"/>more, and is very careful to walk more holily for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, notable is that example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> was tempted to a pleaſing ſinne, oh (ſaith he) <hi>How ſhall I commit this great wickedneſſe, and ſo ſinne againſt God,</hi> how ſhould hee now breake his peace with God, and runne upon a new ſcore with God: It is certaine, he had ſinned before, and he had found pardon of it. And how ſhould he now ſinne any more againſt God: this is the conſtant care of every Chriſtian man, he is fearful of every ſin.</p>
            <p>I grant you, it is true, that ſometimes, even thoſe that have their ſinnes pardoned, and the writing of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by which they had ingaged themſelves to everlaſting torments hath been cancelled, yet even they have afterwards turned the grace of God into wantonneſſe, through ſinfull luſts. As <hi>David and Peter &amp;c.</hi> through ſome corruption or other; but you ſhall alſo find this to be true, that as they have been over-taken and over-whelmed with ſuch corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as thoſe be, ſo they have held forth as much repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and affliction in this caſe; that if you had taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lives from them, you could not have greived them ſo much as in this caſe they are put to. The blotting out of the ſence of this pardon, hath been more bitter to them then death it ſelfe: And if it be not ſo, that Chriſtian men in ſuch a caſe doe not more ſhame themſelves before God, and loath themſelves for all the evills they have done in Gods ſight; they will either lye downe ſeared and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and their ſpirituall life will evaporate away, and then it will argue, it was never true, and ſincere; and if it were true; it will lye ſo cloſe and hidden, that you may plainly ſee what a ſlaughter Satan hath made, and what heavy load hee hath put upon ſuch as are careleſſe to maintaine that peace with God, which hee hath vouchſafed them. And therefore if God give us hearts to keep our peace, it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident ſigne God is at peace with us.</p>
            <p>If we fly from ſin, as from the grave or hell, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe ſinnes are pardoned which we doe abhorre. And that peace and reconſiliation is procured which wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:117852:56"/>
            <p> That is the nature of Spirituall life,<note place="margin">Property of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life.</note> it deſires to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it ſelfe, and to expell all that is contrary to it, if the body have taken any noyſome and hurtfull thing; it wil vomit and caſt it out, and will not let it reſt there in quiet, if it be an enemy to our life it will ſtrive againſt it, if there be any ſpirituall life in us, it cannot let ſin reſt in us; it will ſtrive againſt it, and never reſt till it be ſhut of it, any way, ſome way or other, out it muſt, though he ſhame himſelfe for it by an open confeſſion; and though it many wayes trouble him, yet out it muſt, it is an enemy to his life, and out he muſt caſt it; and therefore if God give us hearts to be fearfull of ſinne, and carefull to maintaine our peace, it is an evident ſigne of the truth of our Spirituall life; and this is a ſigne of life, for he feels not his peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is clouded in him; he diſcernes no life in him, and he feares what he had was but a deluſion. Why, how ſtands thy care to preſerve thy peace, and to avoyd the danger of the loſſe of it? If God give thee an heart deſirous and carefull to maintaine thy peace, though it be not ſo lively as ſometimes it was, yet it is certainly true and good.</p>
            <p>A third ſigne and effect of the life of righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Love of God a ſigne of ſpirituall life.</note> is that which our Saviour gives, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. <hi>Her ſins are forgiven her, which are many, for ſhe loved much.</hi> So then, this is a third ſigne that our ſins are pardoned, and of the life of our juſtification, our love of God. Love of God, <hi>proportionable and ſutable,</hi> according to the greatneſſe of the ſins that have been forgiven and pardoned to us; this is a good evidence of the life of our juſtification, this is not a dead and a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pardon. A Prince may pardon a Malefactor of his form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er offence, but he can put no new principle into him; but Gods Pardons doth convey life into the ſoule, and it hath this worke in it; when the ſoule ſees that all its ſins are done away, and thoſe ſins many and great, as many and great ſins are forgiven him; ſo is his love great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and this is of the ſame nature of the love there ſpoken of; ſhe was a wicked women, and very notorious for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, for ſo ſaid the people, verſ. 38, 39. <hi>Surely if this man were a Prophet, he would know what manner of woman this was,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:117852:57"/>for ſhe is a ſinner.</hi> And when they ſay, <hi>A ſinner,</hi> they meane not ſuch a ſinner as other men and women ordinarily be, but ſuch a ſinner as was a notorious wicked woman, and therefore a ſhame for him that profeſt himſelfe to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to come ſo neare her; ſhe begins to <hi>waſh, and to kiſſe his feet,</hi> and to <hi>wipe them with the haire of her head, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint him with precious oyntment.</hi> Now ſaith Chriſt, to <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee (and he was none of the worſt of them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) for Chriſt ſeemes to imply, that he had ſome ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him; <hi>I have ſomething to ſay unto thee,</hi> Simon, <hi>there was a Creditor had two Debtors, the one owed five hundred pence, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fifty, and when they had nothing to pay, he franckly forgave them both; tell me therefore, which of them will love him moſt?</hi> Why, ſaith he, <hi>I ſuppoſe him to whom he forgave moſt; And Jeſus ſaid, thou haſt rightly judged, ſince I entred into thy houſe thou gaveſt me no water for my feet, &amp;c. wherefore I ſay unto thee, her ſinnes which are many are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much.</hi> Shee ſhewed wonderfull much love, ſhe ſate behind him weeping, when ſhe though ſhe had not been ſo much ſeen, not preſuming to come into his preſence: <hi>Now therefore her ſins which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are forgiven her.</hi> You may ſee it plainly, becauſe ſhe loveth ſo much; and thou that haſt ſhewed leſſe love, thou haſt leſſe forgiven thee, but they that have many ſins forgiven them, <hi>they have much;</hi> And therefore if a mans ſins be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, and God give him peace in the pardon of them, according to the meaſure and multitude of his ſins, ſuch is the meaſure and variety of his love, the greatneſſe of his love to God; and as God hath forgiven him many ſins, ſo hee gives God manifold meaſures of love, he loves God great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the very feet of God;</hi> the loweſt and pooreſt members of the Body of Chriſt. He is content to ſtoop to the meaneſt office of love to Chriſt, or to any of his ſervants; any thing wherein love may be ſhewed to Chriſt, or his Members, he is content to ſtoop to it: According to what is thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, ſuch is thy love.</p>
            <p>And becauſe no man hath ſo little forgiven him, but if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be forgiven him at all, he knows that little is ſo much, and ſo great, as would indeed have plunged him into
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:117852:57"/>the neathermoſt Hel; and therefore no true Chriſtian is conceited of the ſmalneſſe of his ſins, but he thinkes it a very great matter to have any one ſinne forgiven him; but he knowes if God had caſt him out of his ſight for any one of them, juſt had his Judgements been, and if at any time his love decay, he renewes it by repentance of that ſinne, for which before God had vouchſafed him pardon. And thus you ſee a ſix-fold ſigne of our ſpiritual life, three from the cauſes, and three from the effects; and the latter, the three effects chiefly concerne the life of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And therefore doe but apply it home to your ſoules,<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole diſcourſe is but an application, and an uſe of the point; but I pray you conſider what you have heard, and lay it to heart, and draw neare now into the cloſet of your ſpirits, that you may diſcerne what God hath done for you. Did you yet ever ſee any peace of Conſcience? you ſay, I never had a troubled unquiet Conſcience all my dayes; but to you I only ſay thus much, your peace hath neither a good root, nor will it bring forth any good fruit, not well rooted; for I pray you, whence came it? did it come from any word of Gods Promiſe, or any worke of the Spirit of grace, or from thy Selfe love, or is it not as benumbed peace? and if ſo, then it is not wel rooted.</p>
            <p>And truly it hath and wil have as bad fruits, for if thou ſayeſt, thy ſins are pardoned, then what care haſt thou to keep that peace, and to preſerve it? Doth not a ſin befall thee, but it is an annoyance to thy ſpirituall life, and thou canſt not reſt till thou beeſt ſhut of it, and cannot be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till thou beeſt wholly diſcharged of it; it is wel, but if thou findeſt that thou canſt live quietly in knowne ſins, and thy ſoule is never troubled about them, this is then but a barren and falſe-hearted peace, and will deceive thee, and in the midſt of this peace thou mayeſt ſinke into Hell, unleſſe God heale this diſtempered peace in thee; and if God have given thee ſuch a peace, what love doeſt thou then return to God? Where is that great and manifold love thou gives to God? If this love be wanting, and thy care to preſerve
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117852:58"/>it be wanting; If thy peace be groundleſſe and fruitleſſe, then ſpirituall life is wanting, but if God have been pleaſed, and thine own heart can find it ſo, and bear witneſſe to thy ſoule, that God hath pardoned thy ſinnes, then that peace which is in thy ſoul will refreſh thee; Haſt thou ever found ſuch a peace in thy ſoul, as hath been unſpeakable and full of glory, and thou haſt been ſweetly quieted when many troubles have been about thee, and haſt thou found com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from hence in any of the Ordinances of God? And doſt thou find, that though that peace then gotten be in a great meaſure loſt and decayed, yet thou haſt as great a care as may be to preſerve it, and to maintain it, and to renew, and to recover it again by repentance, and art careful to preſerve thy ſelfe ſpotleſſe before the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And doſt thou find that according as God hath been mercifull to thee, ſo thy love is great and manifold, thou canſt never love God ſo much as he hath done thee; thou canſt never anſwer the thouſand part of his love and mercy ſhewed to thee? And then no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, or office ſo meane that he calls thee to, but to the utmoſt of thy indeavor art willing to ſpend and be ſpent for God, then it is an evident argument that juſtification is conveyed to thy ſoule; for God hath given thee peace, and hath given thee an heart to love him back again.</p>

               <hi>Hee that hath the Son hath life,</hi> not only in the pardon of his ſin, but he hath likewiſe the graces of Gods ſpirit, which are the life of ſanctification,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A frame of grace wrought in the ſoule, which is the life of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe Sanctification is found, partly in the heart, and partly in the life. Let me now ſhew you ſome ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſpirituall life, as are found in the heart of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: And breathe forth themſelves in his life, by thoſe habits and gifts which are principally within.</p>
            <p>And the ſum of what I ſhall now ſay is thus much. There are certaine variety of the graces of God in themſelves ſo different and oppoſite. As that in nature they are ſeldome compatible to one perſon, at one and the ſame time, or leaſt of all to be found in one and the ſame buſineſſe, And yet
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:117852:59"/>are found where ever the heart of a man is ſanctified by the Spirit of grace; where you have the life of ſanctification in a Chriſtian, you ſhall finde variety of graces in them, ſome of them of ſuch diverſity and oppoſition one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in nature the like temper is not to be found in one perſon at the ſame time, and in the ſame buſineſſe. They are certaine kind of conjugations, or companions of grace ſo fitted, and joyned together in the heart of a man, as that nature is not able to compact ſuch ſanctified affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, unto ſuch uſes upon any occaſion; much leſſe able to bring them forth upon any occaſion, they are ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in themſelves; to name ſome of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if you looke at the grace of God as it workes in the heart,<note place="margin">Ioy and griefe in the ſoule ſanctified at once.</note> and exerciſes it ſelfe in the converſion of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, you ſhall finde, that when the ſoule diſcernes any life of grace in its heart, that ſin is now pardoned, and God is pleaſed to frame it anew, and to give it a new life; at that time the heart is taken up with theſe two contrary effects; it is both inlarged with no ſmall meaſure of joy, that ever God ſhould redeeme him from ſuch a deſperate condition as his ſoul lay in, and yet withall full of grief of heart, that ever he ſhould have ſo much diſpleaſed that God, that hath done ſo much for him; and ſo plaine, as that you ſhall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcerne the voyce of your own joy, from the voyce of your owne griefe. I know not better how to inſtance in it, then to fetch a reſemblance from the returne of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from captivity to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2, 3, 4. <hi>When God turned the captivity of his people,</hi> this was their affection; <hi>then was their mouth filled with laughter, and their tongue with ſinging,</hi> &amp;c. Now the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſo rejoyce to ſee themſelves redeemed by the Arme of the Lord, when they doe rejoyce to ſee themſelves ſet at liberty from the captivity, they doe at the ſame time as ſadly grieve and weepe, to conſider the unkindneſſe they have put upon God, and their unworthineſſe of ſuch a mercy from him, as you may read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5. ſpeaking of the ſame people, and of the ſame time, their return from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:117852:59"/>the captivity; and he tels you, <hi>They ſhall come, going and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſhall they goe, and ſeek the Lord God, and aske the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward;</hi> If the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes of it, he ſaith, they were out of, and beyond themſelves for joy, as in a comfortable dreame; the newes ſeemed to be too good to be true, and they rejoyced with exceeding great joy, and if the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeake of the very ſame people, and the ſame time, and the very ſame action; he tells you, <hi>They goe to Jeruſalem, weeping, they goe to ſeek the Lord, and aske the way to Zion;</hi> they rejoyce at the greatneſſe of the mercy, and weep in ſence of their unworthineſſe of it. And truly this kinde of combination ſhall you finde ſtirring in every ſoule that is converted to God, when the pardon of its ſin is ſealed to its heart; it breeds a certaine kind of inward joy, and comfort in the Lord, that hath thus graciouſly pardoned their iniquity, and yet more abundantly mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the evils, it hath ſo diſpleaſed God with; nor is there any mourning ſo deeply woundeth the ſoule, as that which ariſeth from the ſight of Chriſt crucified, then the ſoule mournes full bitterly, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. He wil mourne exceedingly, to thinke that he ſhould deale ſo unworthily againſt that God, that hath all this while had ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thoughts of peace towards him. This is the firſt combination of graces that is found in the ſoule after ſinne is pardoned, and the heart reſtored to a new life, for wee ſpake before of prizing Chriſt in our judgements, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine preparative graces, but now we ſpeak of that kind of life of ſanctification, which puts forth it ſelfe after ſome ſence of our juſtification; this life of the mixture of joy and mourning, beares witneſſe to our life of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the worſhipping of God in thoſe duties of the life of ſanctification,<note place="margin">2. Joy and feare.</note> you ſhall finde another combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mixed affections, the like of which are not, and cannot be found in nature; and that is joy and feare, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling.</hi> A Chriſtian man when he is in a good frame, and the life of grace moſt ſtirres in his ſpirit, he never
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:117852:60"/>comes to an holy duty but with ſome holy fear, and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before God, before whom he then ſtands, and yet there is no duties he goes about with more comfort and joy then thoſe, when his heart is not dead. It is true, a dead hearted Chriſtian comes to good duties like a Beare to a ſtake, while they are in ſuch a temper; if they can ſhun duties they wil, but take the heart of a Chriſtian when it is alive, and then they are a willing people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. they come with ſome inward gladneſſe of heart, it is the joy of their ſpirits to heare of an opportunity when they may heare the Word, and pray, or performe any duty accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God: but how? when their hearts are moſt joyful, and they goe about duties moſt willingly, yet then moſt awfully; for take you a Chriſtian when he comes unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, his heart is not much affected with feare and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but then he is moſt awfull when his heart is in the beſt frame towards holy duties; theſe two affections never meet in other things, when a man goes about any buſineſſe gladly, he is not afraid of it; or if he be in feare, he goes not about it joyfully; the Sun trembles not at his courſe, but rejoyces to run his race; the Horſe rejoyceth at the Battaile, he never trembles at the matter; or when any man goes about any worke with joy, he never trembles at it: but a Chriſtian man, when he goes about any ſpirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though he have much joy and comfort in it, and is glad of the occaſion, yet he is moſt fearfull; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. the very conſideration of the greatneſſe of Gods mercies makes a ſoule fearefull of the preſence of God; ſo the more rich God in grace and mercy is to us, either pardoning ſin, or ſanctifying the heart, or quickning us to any duty, the more fearefull is the ſoule in ſuch a condition. And hence is that you read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. the Lord is ſaid to be <hi>fearfull in praiſes;</hi> when the heart is moſt enlarged to praiſe God with comfort, then doth it moſt feare God, ſo that here is another combination of graces that are not commonly found together in other buſineſſes of ordinary affaires, but where the heart is ſpirituall, they meet together in the ſame thing.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:117852:60"/>
            <p> Thirdly, Take you a godly man in affliction,<note place="margin">Ioy in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> and when he is moſt able to bear them, and yet when afflictions is moſt heavy, if he find his heart able to grapple under them, yet then you ſhall find much joy and ſadneſſe of heart mixed together, it was a ſigne of the election of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> becauſe they <hi>received the word in much affliction, and with joy of the Holy ghoſt.</hi> When they found much affliction either by the word, or in the outward man, though much affliction, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly joyous, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11, <hi>No affliction is joyous for the preſent, yet it brings forth the quiet fruites of righteouſneſſe.</hi> By how much the more affliction, makes their ſpirits ſad, yet ſo much the more is the heart inlarged with joy and comfort in the Holy ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We rejoyce in tribulations,</hi> tribulation is ſuch a kind of affliction, as is a threſhing us like corne out of the chaffe, drives us out of all the comforts of this life, and that is not in nature, to rejoyce in any meaſure, when the heart is in grief and diſcouragement, it ever wants ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to raiſe it up.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is this mixture of affection, in our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards men, which argues the life of holineſſe in us;<note place="margin">Patience without forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> In our converſeing with men, you ſhal have the ſame heart full of much patience, but without all forbearance. And thoſe are ſuch as are not found in nature, nor in an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, yet in a Chriſtian heart you ſhall find them together the more patient a man is towards others, yet the leſſe able is he to bear with evill, read <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I know thy workes, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not beare them which are evill:</hi> A man would think it were a very ſtrange expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>A man of known and prooved patience, and yet cannot bear: For what is patience, but bearing and forbearing? yet ſaith God, <hi>I know thy patience, and that thou canſt not beare them that are evill;</hi> implying that ſuch a ſoule, if it were a matter to be put upon himſelfe, any affliction or tryall put upon himſelfe, then I know thy patience in bearing of it, but if it come to a matter of evill, not of puniſhment, but of ſinne, then I know thou canneſt not bear it.</p>
            <p>Take you any patient man, that onely hath a moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117852:61"/>of patience; and if he have ſo much patience as that he can bear with croſſes, and afflictions, he can as well alſo beare with evills committed againſt God: but this is the nature of ſpirituall patience, it is mixed with zeale, ſo as that the more patient a man is, in regard of injuries done to himſelfe, the leſſe patient he is in reſpect of injuries done to God.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, You ſhall have gentleneſſe and meekneſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mixed in a man, with much auſterity and ſtrictneſſe, which is very much they ſhould meet in one man,<note place="margin">Meeknes and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe at once.</note> at one and the ſame time: The wiſdome that is from above is gentle and meek, and eaſie to be intreated.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Hee was the meekeſt man upon earth, Numb.</hi> 12.3. Take <hi>Moſes</hi> in his owne caſe, and his carriage towards men, as they had reſpect to himſelfe, and then he was a meek man, ſoon perſwaded, yet the ſame <hi>Moſes,</hi> when hee ſaw the matter concerned the Cauſe of God, hee is ſo ſtiffe and unmoveable, as that he wil not yeeld one jot, he wil not <hi>leave an hoofe behind, of all that appertained to the children of Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 10.26. He would not onely have men, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children goe forth to ſerve the Lord, but their cattle and their ſtuffe; He will not yeeld a little here, no not for the Kings pleaſure ſake. A man would much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch a man, ſo meek and gentle, and ſo eaſie to be perſwaded in his owne cauſe, that yet when it comes to a matter of importance, and concerns God, hee will not there yeeld, he is now inflexible, nothing can perſwade him to give way to it, this is a combination of graces, that are not wont to be found in men thus mixed together, but it is found in the people of God, that live a ſanctified, and holy life. I know not better what to inſtance in, then in the liquid Aire; of all other things the moſt eaſieſt to be peirced through; of it ſelfe it gives way to every creature, not the leſt flye, or leaſt ſtone caſt into it, but it gives way to it of it ſelfe, yet if God ſay it ſhall be as a Firmament, between the waters above, and the waters below, it then ſtands like a wall of braſſe, and yeelds not; it will not ſuffer the water in the clouds to fal down, but if it do fal to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:117852:61"/>water the earth, it ſhall ſtraine through the aire as through a ſieve, the clouds ſometimes are ſo full that one would thinke they would burſt through the aire, and fall upon the earth, but God having ſet the aire to be a Firmament, or expulſon between the waters above, and the waters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, though of it ſelfe a very liquid thing, yet it ſtands like to a <hi>wall of braſſe;</hi> and truly ſo is it with a Chriſtian ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though of himſelfe he is as liquid as the aire, you may eaſily paſſe through him, and goe an end with him eaſily; he is eaſie to be intreated, very gentle, but take him now in any thing wherein God hath bid him keep his ſtand in his courſe, and there he ſtands <hi>like a wall of braſſe,</hi> that were never ſuch high and great matters put upon him, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to beare him downe, he will not ſhrinke, nor give any way at all; this is another mixture of affections which are found in Chriſtian men, that doe enjoy this life of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place you ſhall have modeſty mixed with much magnanimity,<note place="margin">Modeſty mixed with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity.</note> which is rarely found in men, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only with Morrall or Civill gifts, but in nature the more modeſt, the leſſe magnanimous. But a Chriſtian, the more modeſt he is, the more magnanimous; look at <hi>Paul,</hi> and touching the <hi>righteouſneſſe which is of the Law,</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with many carnall priviledges according to the Law, but now all theſe are but loſſe, and droſſe, <hi>and dung, that he might win Chriſt;</hi> all his good parts of nature, and all his, common gifts of grace, yet all of them but droſſe, and dung; this was the modeſt ſpirit of <hi>Paul,</hi> a man who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>He was not inferiour to the very chief Apoſtles,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.11. yet againe ſaith he, <hi>I am nothing,</hi> there is his magnanimity. When he is oppoſed, and vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the falſe Apoſtles; what hath <hi>Paul</hi> forgot his modeſty, now, that he knowes not how to ſubmit himſelfe, nor to compare himſelfe with his equals? No, but though <hi>chiefe of the Apoſtles,</hi> yet <hi>am I nothing.</hi> He lookes at every thing he had as nothing; <hi>This I am,</hi> but yet <hi>I am nothing.</hi> He ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times calls himſelfe, <hi>the leaſt of all the Apoſtles,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.9, 10 and yet other whiles, <hi>not inferiour to the very chiefe of them.</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:117852:62"/>Sometimes he calls himſelfe, <hi>the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> Eph. 3.8. and yet ſometimes, <hi>not inferiour to the very chiefe Apoſtles;</hi> and this <hi>he had learned,</hi> he had been inſtructed thus to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; he deſired, that he might <hi>know nothing but Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> See the noble ſpirit of this ſelfe-deniall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God; ſometimes, whey the Magiſtrates had done him wrong, ſee then how he ſtands upon his priviledges, he complaines, <hi>they had beaten him, a Roman, being uncondem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> Act. 16.9. and when they heard this, they would have ſent him away privately; nay, <hi>let them come and fetch him out.</hi> See now, a man of a great and magnanimous ſpirit, though a man as fit to put up wrongs as any man, yet when he ſees the glory of God is intereſted in his perſon, and his calling, or his cauſe is called in queſtion, then he knowes how to ſtand upon his worth; and if in ſuch a caſe he ſuſtaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen wrong, then he will plead the liberty of a Subject; whereas at another time, he would have done more to a farre leſſe man then a Magiſtrate; <hi>He is become all things to all men, that he might ſave ſome every way;</hi> ſo gentle, that you may turn him about your hand any way, but elſe he wil ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his worth, and not inferiour to the very chief Apoſtles; thoſe that are greateſt and chiefeſt, ſuch, <hi>who ſeemed to be pillars,</hi> he is not inferiour to any of them, the greateſt of them all; equall to the beſt of them, if not before them all, and yet <hi>laboured more then they all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. laſt. to ſhew you the marvellous modeſty of the ſpirit of grace, a work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compattible to nature, but is found only in a ſpirit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and there only they are combined together in the ſame perſon, at the ſame time, and in the ſame buſineſſe, with the ſame breath he can tell you; <hi>He is not inferiour to the very chief Apoſtles,</hi> and yet, <hi>I am nothing.</hi> Notable is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>David</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>My eyes are not lofty, nor my heart haughty, but I have behaved may ſelfe as a weaned childe,</hi> Pſal. 131.1, 2, Now you would thinke if a man were ſuch a weaned humble creature, he could not tell how to ſpeake, nor to take any great things in hand; but when he comes to ſpeake to that,<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.7. opened.</note> you ſhall marke the frame of his ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7.9. <hi>Stand open ye everlasting doores, and be ye lift up ye

            <p>Thus you have ſeene ſix combinations ſeverally of the gracious affections, that are not to bee found in nature, no not ſet upon civill objects, much leſſe upon ſpirituall, but upon civill objects, they cannot be ſo combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of graces.</note> there is another combination of vertues ſtrangely mixed in every lively holy Chriſtian, And that is, Diligence in wordly buſineſſes, and yet deadneſſe to the world; ſuch a myſtery as none can read, but they that know it. For a man to <hi>riſe early, and goe to bed late, and eate the bread of carefullneſſe,</hi> not a ſinfull, but a provident care,<note place="margin">Diligence in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſines, and yet dead to the world.</note> and to avoid idleneſſe, cannot indure to ſpend any idle time, takes all opportunities to be doing ſomething, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and late, and looſeth no opportunity, go any way and beſtir himſelfe for profit, this will he doe moſt diligently in his calling: And yet bee a man dead-hearted to the world, <hi>the diligent hand maketh rich, Prov.</hi> 10.4. and you read of the godly woman, that ſhe <hi>riſeth while it is yet night, Prov.</hi> 31.27. And of this ye read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.13. and 18, 19.27. Now if this be a thing which is ſo common in the mouth of the holy ghoſt, and you ſee was the practice of the greateſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then upon the earth; the greateſt Princes in thoſe times, the more gracious, the more diligent, and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their callings: you ſee it will well ſtand with the life of grace, very diligent in worldly buſineſſe. And yet notwithſtanding, the very ſame ſouls that are moſt ful of the worlds buſineſſes, the more diligent they be in their callings, yet the ſame persons are directed <hi>to be dead with Chriſt, Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Set not your affections upon things below, but on things that are above, for we are dead with Chriſt.</hi> Meaning dead to all theſe earthly things, and all the comforts here below, they are not our life, but our <hi>life is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> and therefore to this world are we dead. And <hi>Paul</hi> therefore ſo ſpeakes of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>The world is crucified to me, and I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:117852:64"/>unto the world,</hi> the very ſame men that are ſo crucified to the world, yet the ſpirits of thoſe men, though their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be in heaven, yet their labours are in the earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven,</hi> but our imployments is here upon the earth, diligently taking paines in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ever very buſie in outward imployments. <hi>Obſerve the Ante, learne her wayes, and be wiſe, Prov.</hi> 6. be buſie like Antes, morning and evening, early and late, and labour diligently with their hands, and with their wits, and which way ſoever as may be the beſt improvement of a mans tallent; it muſt be imployed to the beſt advantage, and yet when a man hath laboured thus buſily, yet his heart, and mind, and affections are above; he goes about all his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in obedience to Gods Commandement, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the glory of God; and he thereby ſets himſelfe, and his houſhold at more liberty for the ſervice of God in their places, and ſo, though hee labour moſt diligently in his calling, yet his heart is not ſet upon theſe things, he can tell what to doe with his eſtate when he hath got it. Say not therefore when you ſee two men labouring very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and buſily in the world, ſay not, here is a couple of worldlings, for two men may do the ſame buſineſſe, and have the ſame ſucceſſe, and yet a marvellous difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, the heart of the one may be dead to theſe things, he looks at them as they be; indeed, <hi>but crums that fall from the childrens table,</hi> he lookes not at them as his cheifeſt good, but <hi>the bread of life,</hi> the ſpirituall food of his ſoule, that is the thing which he cheifly labours after, another man places his happineſſe and felicity in them, and makes them his cheifeſt good, and ſo there is a manifeſt difference between them.</p>
            <p>So then you ſee ſeven combinations of graces that are in the life of holineſſe, and all of ſingular uſe in this kind.</p>
            <p>Eightly, the laſt vertue is a ſingle one, and that is love of enemyes.<note place="margin">Love of Enemies.</note> 
               <hi>I ſay unto you, love your enemies, Matth.</hi> 5.44. <hi>that you may be the children of your heavenly Father.</hi> Love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This very grace whereby we doe love our enemyes,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:117852:64"/>it hath a contrary worke to nature, for naturally, this we ſhall finde to be the frame of our hearts, towards our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we are cold and undiſpoſed to doe any good office unto them, very hard and cold, and frozen towards them: Thoſe who are our enemies, we take no pleaſure in them, but now in ſuch a caſe as this, the love of a Chriſtian will come and warme the heart, and thaw this cold froſtineſſe that is in our ſoules; whereas before a man was cold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Enemies, his heart now begins to reflect upon him in pitty and compaſſion; and inſtead of hardneſſe, his heart now melts and is made ſoft within him, to ſee what ill meaſures it could have put upon its enemies. But on the contrary ſide, the ſame hatred in a man that is towards his enemyes, it makes a man of an hot diſtemper, with boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heat of wrath againſt his enemies, he is all upon it to doe him any harme, his heart is full of hot and bitter wrath; ſo as that love which was as heat and fire to thaw and warme, cold and hard hearts, when it comes to the fire of wrath, it is as it were cold water, and allayes that heat and bitterneſſe, and harſhneſſe, which elſe our hearts are ſubject to.</p>
            <p>This is the nature of love, as it is the nature of water to coole hot diſtempers; and as it is the nature of fire, to thaw and ſoften hard frozen ſpirits, &amp; ſo though it be but as one intire grace. Yet in the act it puts forth a kind of variety of worke, whereby one would thinke it did croſſe it ſelfe, but it doth not, but doth all by the life of Chriſt: thus you ſee what the effects of the life of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the heart of a man, after that God hath begun, to roote the life of juſtification in us, and hee diſcernes that God hath wrought a change in him, and then theſe ſeverall graces, though in themſelves, and worke one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to another; yet in a Chriſtian heart they can meet and joyne together.</p>
            <p>And therefore now doe but lay this to heart, <hi>he that hath the Sonne hath life.</hi> Will a Chriſtian ſay, how ſhal I know that I have that life, in having of which, I may know I have Chriſt? Why, do but conſider with thine owne ſoule,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:117852:65"/>not now of the life of thy juſtification, but haſt thou found that ever God did fill thy heart <hi>with joy,</hi> ſo as thy ſoule hath ſaid, the Lord hath done great things for my ſoule, whereof he hath made me to rejoyce? and haſt thou found that when thou haſt moſt rejoyced in the wonderfull mercy of God, then hath thy heart moſt melted before the Lord thy God? And thou haſt been aſhamed and confounded within thy ſelfe, and never open thy mouth againſt God any more. Doeſt thou ſee that the more God reveales Chriſt to thee, who was crucified for thy ſake, the more bitterly thou moaneſt for thy wickedneſſe? then it is a ſtrong evidence of life and peace in thy ſoule; were it not the mighty power of the life of Chriſt in thee, thou could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have had neither of both theſe graces, much leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together to worke the ſame thing, at one and the ſame time: if therefore God hath helped you to looke at the great mercy of God with joy, and yet with ſhame and bitter mourning, that ever thou ſhouldeſt diſhonour ſuch a God; certainly, God hath vouchſafed thee life, and ſuch a life, as in which thou ſhalt live. You ſhall have many a ſoule that is marvellouſly comforted in hearing the word, rejoyce exceedingly in what they heare; and goe home and ſay ſuch a word was good and very comfortable, and never man ſpake like that man, and he never thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there was ſo much to be found in the word, as now he conceives there is. But now if this were the <hi>joy of Gods Elect;</hi> if it were ſuch a joy as would not vaniſh away like lightning in the aire, a flaſh of joy, it would ſinke downe into the heart, and leave ſo much the more deeper impreſſion mourning, by how much the more it hath had joy: I grant, that ſometimes the joy of Gods owne ſervants may ſoone vaniſh away, but it was never knowne that the joy of a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian did ſo ſoone vaniſh and depart away, but that when it did moſt abound in the heart, it did cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mourning, and if not weeping, yet an affection of greife and ſorrow of ſoule; that ever we have ſo diſpleaſed God, the more God hath been mercifull to us, the more are we ſhamed of ourſelves, &amp; inwardly grieve for our ſhameleſſe carriages.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:117852:65"/>
            <p> If therefore you only finde joy in hearing, that may deceive you, it is not the ſhortneſſe of the continuance that argues the unſoundneſſe of the joy, but the want of this combination that will argue the falſhood of it; if God yoake not ſpirituall joy with ſpirituall mourning, then ſuſpect your joy, for it doth not accompany ſalvation unto life. And in very deed, this you ſhall find to be true, the joy of living ſoules in Chriſt, though that oftentimes bee ſoon gone, yet it leaves this ſpirit of mourning, which keeps poſſeſſion for it, and that many times for a long time; and you may read your comfort in the ſorrow that it hath left behind, for there is as much cauſe of comfort in this ſorrow, as in the joy when you had it; when you ſee your ſoules can mourne unfeignedly, for that you ſee ſo good a God to ſuch a wretch; this very comfortable ſorrow that is left in thy heart, is an undoubted pledge that it is not a vaniſhing joy, the power and work of it laſts long, and wil abide in the ſoule for ever; a man will in ſuch a caſe mourne for his ſin while he lives. If you have therefore found your joy mixed with ſorrow it is right, elſe it is but a fading, hypocriticall, and falſe joy.</p>
            <p>Againe further, how doe you finde your heart affected with the duties of Gods worſhip? Doe you come to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties marvellous unwillingly, that if you could avoyd it you would not keep ſuch duties in your houſe, and if it muſt needs be, you put it upon any body rather then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelfe; you may be a living Chriſtian, but your heart is in a dead frame at that time, and if it be alwayes ſo with you, you never did <hi>truly live,</hi> but if you finde your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, at leaſt your hearts comming on moſt willingly to Chriſtian duties, that you performe them like <hi>Free-will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> not free, ſo as without warrant from Gods Word, <hi>but free</hi> in reſpect of grace. Doe but obſerve thus much, it may be you may come off freely before God, becauſe hee hath given you ſpirituall gifts, and you can quit your ſelves well in the performance of them, and that makes you come the more boldly; but conſider, if the more <hi>willingly</hi> you come to Chriſtian duties, the more <hi>trembling</hi> your heart
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:117852:66"/>goes about them; the more the ſoule is prepared, the more it <hi>feares</hi> before the Lord, and the more <hi>lowly</hi> the ſpirit is, and <hi>awfull</hi> in the ſight of God, if a man can <hi>ſerve the Lord with joy, and trembling</hi> together, then the ſervice you perform to God is heavenly, and ſpirituall, and lively, and ſuch as in which you live, they come from a living heart, and the ſacrifice is lively and acceptable, and argues you have life, and therein you have Chriſt the God of peace, but if a man have only feare in a duty, but no joy; or joy, but no feare; his heart is not in a good frame, we muſt bring a better frame of heart before God then ſo, before we can ſay that we have the life of ſanctification.</p>
            <p>Againe, for another ſigne; How doe you finde your ſelves in your tribulations? are they altogether matter of burden, and wearineſſe to your hearts? Have you no joy in them? Have you many afflictions in inward, or in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and no comfort in them? It is an uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne to you; the life of ſanctification is not ſo ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in your hearts, that you may gather you have life, but if you finde that in the <hi>multitude of your thoughts within you, Gods comforts delight your ſoule,</hi> Pſal. 94.19, 20. In the midſt of ſorrow you finde ſome comfort, if your life in Chriſt makes your ſaddeſt times joyfull and comfortable to you; and ſo in outward afflictions, though afflictions may ſeeme to be grievous, yet waite a while, and you ſhall ſee the more weight and burthen that lyes upon thee, and the <hi>more thy afflictions for Chriſt hath abounded, ſo hath thy conſolation abounded much more,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.6.</p>
            <p>Againe, obſerve your carriage with men, it is good to be patient when you meet with evill doers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. laſt. yet notwithſtanding not ſo patiently as to beare with them in every thing that is evil, to allow them in any ſin; no, if God give you place and opportunity, ſhew ſome kinde of zeal to cleanſe them from their evils, and this may well ſtand with your patience; be patient in things that concerne your ſelfe, but beare not with them that are evil in their evil deeds.</p>
            <p>Againe, doe but obſerve the frame of your ſpirit in the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:117852:66"/>things that you ſuffer; Are you meeke and gentle, and flexible, that is a good vertue; but how are you in the things of God? Are you ſtiffe, and unmoveable there? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. laſt, that though they may perſwade you very farre in any reaſonable thing concerning man,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but in things concerning God, you will not baite any thing of the peace of your Conſcience, for any mans pleaſure; are you unmoveable in ſuch a caſe? both theſe together doe very well, <hi>ſtedfaſt,</hi> and yet <hi>ſoone perſwaded;</hi> ſuch an heart as is thus mixed, and knowes how to temper and frame his ſpirit according to God, he is a living ſoule, and hath life, and Chriſt the Prince of life.</p>
            <p>Againe, thou art a modeſt Creature, and thinkeſt mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thy ſelfe, and art weaned from this world, it is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but how is it coupled, for God couples every grace with another grace, that they may poyſe one another, as Chriſt ſent out his Diſciples, <hi>by two and two together;</hi> ſo all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit joyne one with another, they ballance one another, that he may not be too high on the one ſide, nor too low on the other, but that all things may be carried according to God, and therefore thou art modeſt; it is well, but haſt thou withall an high and a lofty ſpirit, that if it be heavenly matters thou art to be exerciſed in, they cannot be too high for thee. Let a man tell thee of State matters, comming before Princes, and tell thee of nobility, thou art aſhamed, and knoweſt not how to ſet about ſuch things as thoſe be, but tell thee of an inheritance in the Kingdome of glory, and the making it ſure to thee in a way of Gods grace. Tell thee of pardon of ſinne, and of the Spirit of grace, and the riches of the precious promiſes of God, and thy heart can looke at theſe highly, then thou art of a magnanimous ſpirit, then is thy modeſty in outward things well coupled, but he whoſe ſpirit is moſt lofty ſhould be moſt humble, couple them together and they well ſuit one another; when they goe hand in hand, <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> goe together, <hi>modeſty</hi> and <hi>magnanimity, humility</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> goe together, they make an amiable ſet of grace where-ever they are ſo coupled; if it be of things
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:117852:67"/>concerning thy ſelfe, thou haſt not an heart to ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any man of place, but he may bow thee round about; but if they wrong thee ſo farre as Gods honour is intereſted in the thing, thou canſt then ſtand upon thy lawfull rights, and if therein thou be impeached, thou canſt come off with this, <hi>thou art not inferiour to the chiefe Apoſtles,</hi> and yet <hi>art no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> nor art able to doe any thing.</p>
            <p>Againe, looke at thy worldly buſineſſe, art thou dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in thy Calling, it is well; and you ſay, <hi>Curſed is he that doth the worke of the Lord negligently;</hi> and the work of his Calling is, the worke of the Lord. But how ſtands thy heart affected in the midſt of thy buſineſſe? Is thy heart dead to the world, goe not about it with a worldly heart, goe not about it for profit ſake, but becauſe God ſets thee about it? And you are more free to the ſervice of God, and to doe more good, this is the life of ſanctification.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, if God give us hearts ſo abundant in love, that it both thawes our cold and ſtiffe hearts towards our poore Brethren, and alſo puts a watery temper to coole the wilde-fire of our wrath towards our enemies; it is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of the Spirit of grace to turne it ſelfe ſo many wayes, for the right ordering and framing of a Chriſtian in the courſe of his ſanctification; theſe be comfortable ſignes of our life of ſanctification.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow we come to ſpeake of ſuch effects of the life of Sanctification,<note place="margin">Effects of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſignes of ſpiritual life.</note> as ſhew themſelves in the lives of Chriſtians, by obſerving of which in our ſelves we may know we have Chriſt, and life in him.</p>
            <p>Now theſe effects are ſuitable to the effects of naturall life, and they are principally five.</p>
            <p>The firſt is motion,<note place="margin">1 Effect motion.</note> when a creature is able to move it ſelf unto the duties of its place; it is an effect of naturall life, when it is able to move it ſelfe in its place, then it is ſaid to live ſuch or ſuch a life; if you ſee a Creature ſtirres, and moves not further then by the help of another, then you ſay, it lives not; but if it ſtirre of it ſelfe, then you ſay, it lives: Nor is it ſtrait way alive if it move, unleſſe it be in its place, for you ſee earthly things will move downward, if they be upward, and light things will move upward; but theſe are out of their places, they are rather moved then themſelves doe move, when they are out of their place; and it is not ſo much from a power of moving, but rather an affection to reſt, then a power to move themſelves. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuppoſe they ſhould move themſelves, meet it is they ſhould move themſelves to ſuch actions as argues as argue this, and that life which they expreſſe; ſuppoſe a Tree moves it ſelfe, and nouriſh it ſelfe, and grow, and that in its place, yet it doth not move it ſelfe to ſee, nor heare; and beaſts that doe move themſelves to ſee, and heare, yet
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:117852:68"/>they cannot move themſelves to acts of Reaſon; and men that can move to acts of Reaſon, yet cannot move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any ſpirituall duty and work of grace, ſo that that motion which argues the life of the ſoule, is a power to move it ſelfe, and in its place unto ſpirituall duties, that is the true nature of the life of ſanctification; doe you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee a creature no further moving it ſelfe then according to its lightneſſe. You ſhall ſometimes have men to move themſelves out of their levity, come to an eminent duty in the pride of their natures,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and will lift themſelves up to ſome duties; but this is not out of an inward principle, but out of the lightneſſe of their ſpirits deſire to be above,<note place="margin">Lightneſs of ſpirit.</note> will move them to this and that duty, and rather move from hence then from any inward principle of grace; and ſo ſometimes creatures out of their heavineſſe, and baſeneſſe of minde, will be doing ſpirituall duties; but as the one doth them to be ſeen of men, and performe the meere letter of the duty, and in the pride of his heart, not out of any inward affection to ſuch duties; ſo there be others that for profit ſake will move themſelves baſely unto ſpirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Chriſt ſaid of his Hearers, they followed him <hi>for loaves,</hi> Joh. 6.26. ſo that it is one thing to move to ſuch or ſuch a buſineſſe, or to be ſtirring about ſuch duties, out of an inward affection to the duty and inclination of heart, and love of ſuch a worke, and another thing to be carried to ſuch workes out of an inward levity of nature, or becauſe by ſuch duties a man may excell others, and goe beyond his neighbours; and it is one thing to be acting and ſtirring in ſpirituall duties, out of an inward love to them, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to performe them, out of a baſe reſpect to the profit, and pleaſure that may be found in them, in outward peace and reſt; as ſometimes the caſe ſo ſtands, that if a man doe betake himſelfe to ſpirituall duties, he ſhall perhaps finde the more favour in the eyes of men, and to pleaſe authority, if it take the better ſide; and ſo from an heavie baſeneſſe of their hearts to ſuch regards; they will have reſpect unto ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duties, but theſe doe not move but as heavie things move, downward, and light things upward; a ſtone will
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:117852:68"/>move downward, and fire upward. <hi>Abſolom</hi> had a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtrong affection to be doing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.4. he tels them every man ſhould have juſtice, <hi>if he was but made King in the Land, ſo all</hi> Iſrael <hi>deſired after him;</hi> but <hi>Abſolom</hi> was now out of his place, but as ſoone as ever he got into the place hee deſired, the firſt thing he intended was to cut off his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life, an act of the greateſt rebellion that ever could be done, ſo that men out of their places are apt to be ſtirring and moving, but it is but either from the baſeneſſe or lightneſſe of their hearts;<note place="margin">Note this.</note> O that I were but in my Maſters place, ſaith a ſervant, I would have duties performed in ſuch time and place, and when they come to be in place, and might order and command their families, then they grow as bad as their Maſters, and it may be worſe, but this are we apt to doe when we are out of our places, apt to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but its not true life, becauſe only that which moves in its place that only lives; and yet further: A thing may move in its place, and yet move from ſome kind of outward reſpects; as a Watch, or a Clock, it moves, but it is from the weight that lyes and hangs upon it, and ſo it is rather a violent motion then a naturall. So is it many times with men, the weight of the Law, or the weight of the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Governours doth ſo carry them an end in thoſe waies they walke in, that they goe through with it, and yet it is but from an outward principle, from ſome outward weights that hangs upon them; but yet, ſuppoſe men ſhould be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their places, as <hi>Jehu</hi> was; he was mighty in his place, and was very much againſt <hi>Baal,</hi> and deſtroyed the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and his children, and his friends; but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding though this was all in his calling, he had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Calling given him of God to that end;<note place="margin">What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a ſpirituall duty.</note> but though you ſhould performe duties in your places, as a tree though it move in its place upward, yet it puts not forth; ſo many a man may doe good duties in his place, and yet be wanting in the graciouſneſſe and ſpirituality of them. Now to make a duty ſpirituall, requires not only that it ſhould be for the better, a good worke, but that it ſhould be wrought.</p>
            <p>Firſt in ſence of our owne inſufficiency without Chriſt, and yet ſo, as that by and from Chriſt we are able to doe it.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:117852:69"/>
            <p> Secondly, that we have ſome reſpect to the Word of God for our warrant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that in all we doe, we have reſpect to the glory of God in all our performances, <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his owne faith.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, he no further puts forth a worke of ſpirituall life, further then he denies his owne ability, ſo farre hee lives by his faith, and depends upon Chriſt for ſupply in every duty he goes about, whether he pray, preach, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Sacraments, or be diligent in his Calling, or in his carriage towards any that ſtand in relation to him, ſo farre as we are ſenſible of our owne failings, and therefore doe depend upon him for ſtrength; theſe are not ſuch as come from common graces,<note place="margin">Common gifts.</note> but doe accompany ſanctification to life. It is true, if men be inveſted with common gifts, they may be acted and moved to many duties in their places, and put out very ſweet affections to the duty, and yet doe it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the power of their owne ſtrength, and rather for their owne glory and applauſe, then from any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Chriſt; ſo that ſpirituall life hath the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus for its root, and the Word for its warrant, and for its rule to walke by, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Then ſhall I never be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandements.</hi> All ſuch actions will be accpptable to God, and ſerviceable to men; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aime at the glory of God for the end, that is, their laſt end, and all ſuch other ends as are ſub-ordinate unto that, the building up of Gods Kingdome, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5, 6, 7. <hi>When ye did eate, did ye it unto me, ſaith the Lord? nay, did ye not doe it to your ſelves?</hi> Hoſ. 7.14. <hi>They have not cryed unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds.</hi> Did you deſire in your prayers to bring in any ſervice to God, to tend to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory? And did you debaſe your owne ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that you might finde help from him? Or, did you not this to your ſelves, or for your owne deliverance, and redemption, and freedome from ſuch bondage and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſeries that lay upon you, ſo that if God ſee men goe about ſuch duties meerly for themſelves, they are wanting of this ſpirituall life. So then, doe but lay theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:117852:69"/>doe you finde a man that is deſirous to be doing good duties, but is it to pleaſe others, or is it out of the bonds of authority that lyes upon him? Doe you ſee them have affection to duties, but out of their place and calling, or in their calling; they doe ſuch duties but rather out of their own ſtrength, then from the ſtrength of Chriſt, and not out of a conſcionable reſpect to all the Commandements of God; or if it be from outward principles, and to wrong ends, the glory of God not ſought after, nor tending to the building up themſelves, nor others in grace; all theſe are ſuch as men may be carried to doe from outward reſpects; they may doe ſomething that one would thinke would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue life, but all the duties they doe by their owne ſtrength is like a Spider, that weaves a webbe out of her owne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, we follow not the rule of the Word exactly, but are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wheeling about to our owne ends, and to thoſe reſpects that concerne our ſelves rather then to the glory of God, and the Churches good; it is true, no man that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graces, men that have gifts of preaching, and gifts of praying may love to act, and move them, or any other zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gift; but yet notwithſtanding you ſhal finde this to be true, that till the heart be ſanctified by the life of Chriſt, we ever detaine all the graces <hi>of God in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> did, detaine the truth of God in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. So we by a ſpirit of ypocriſie, detaine all the graces of God in unrighteouſneſſe, and in Hypocriſie; whereas God hath given us every grace, and the manifeſtation thereof to edifie himſelfe, and to glorifie God withall. We wonderfully magnifie our ſelves withall, and make our ſelves goodly in the eyes of men; we are full of our ſelves, and thinke we have this and that in us that will ſerve our turne, and reach our owne ends, this is not a life of grace, but is indeed a dead worke all that we doe; and therefore reſt not in any ſuch kinde of life and motion: But if you finde an inward inclination of ſoule to Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ll duties, and to thoſe duties in ſpeciall that are pertinent to your place, and if they be not within the compaſſe of your calling, you dare not reach unto them; and in your
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:117852:70"/>calling, you do them not out of deſire to be ſeen of men, but you are doing good duties out of a ſence of your owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to reach any duty in your calling, much leſſe of Gods ſervice, and in them all, you obſerve every commandement of God, and the ends you aime at are ſingly, that God may be glorifyed, and that God may ſee you, and not man; that good may be done by you in your places, in Church, and Family, and Commonwealth, and that thereby others might be brought on to God, and his Kingdome increaſed, this very motion and inclination of your hearts is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you have a ſtirring ſpirit to ſpiritual duties, and this is ſpirituall life in Chriſt: And therefore, by how much the more God ſhall give you an heart to bee doing your works and duties in this order, ſo much the more comfort you ſhal gather to your ſouls, that undoubtedly Chriſt hath <hi>ſhed abroad his ſpirit</hi> in you, by which you are able to doe that which elſe you could not have reached unto.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>You ſay unto me, may not a good Chriſtian man have his heart ſo dead, that he is unfit to pray; or preach, or to inſtruct his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or for the duties of his calling; fit, and good for nothing: And is a ſoule in ſuch a caſe as this altogether void of ſpirituall life, and ſanctification? is there not ſometimes a kind of a coath come upon a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that ſo benumbs his ſpirit, that he performes no duties at all, but if he might have his owne mind, he would not pray at all, nor receive Sacraments? Is not this ſometimes the caſe of Chriſtian? and will you ſay that ſuch an one is a dead ſoule, becauſe he is altogether liſtleſſe, and dead-hearted to move to any ſpirituall duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, there may fall ſuch a deadneſſe upon the heart of Chriſtian men, that they are both unable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to any ſpiritual duty. Which commonly God leaves his ſervants unto, when he hath found them acting and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in their own ſtrength, and upon their detaining of the graces of God in unrighteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Cauſes of deadnes of heart.</note> and diverting them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their own praiſe in the world, then the edifying of the people of God, or the glorifying of his own name, when God ſees we are much of our ſelves, and thinke we can doe much by the ſtrength of grace we have received, then God is wont to leave us cold and dead, ſo as we know not in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:117852:70"/>the world what to doe, nor are we willing to do any thing; The very preſence of a duty, and the thoughts of it, is an horror to ſuch ſoules in ſuch caſes; we have been too buſie in our own ſtrength, and too mighty in the grace we have received, and rather aimed at our ſelves then at him, and then no marvaile if God leave us to a world of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>But when God hath thus by this meanes let us ſee, that all our life is in him, and that we are dead hearted fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we have life from him, then God is wont not to faile, but to help us thus farre at the leaſt, to looke with a wiſt, and a ſad eye upon the forlornnes of our eſtates, and to cry out of our ſelves, O what dead hearted Creatures, and dull ſpirited things are we and bemoane our ſelves as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>I ſee that in me, that is, in my fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt deadneſſe.</note> 
               <hi>dwels no good thing.</hi> Sometimes I have a minde to doe good duties, but I finde that I have no ſtrength to performe; <hi>Paul</hi> comes to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and he had an <hi>open doore,</hi> a faire calling to preach, but he had no heart to it, becauſe he found not <hi>Titus</hi> his brother there. Now when this is the caſe of a Chriſtian man, that he is ſtrait, and dead hearted, he groanes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen of it, and he lookes at it with ſad counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſees he is not well, but is ready to complaine of it; now this ſence and complaint of deadneſſe, and uſing the beſt meanes to raiſe himſelfe up out of this deadneſſe, this is an action of Spirituall life.</p>
            <p>It is an act of Spirituall life for a man to be ſenſible of his owne deadneſſe, which in time workes the ſoule of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to a more conſtant dependance upon Chriſt for life, and makes him more obſerveable of the Word, and more ingenuous and ſincere in looking at the glory of God, and the Churches good, more then his owne; and by how much the more we come to this paſſe, and the more we have reſpect to the Word as our daily rule, ſo much the more All our ſtirrings in our callings is a motion of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, and argues the life of ſanctification, ſhed abroad in our hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another action of life is feeding,<note place="margin">2 Signe of ſpirituall life.</note> the creature
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:117852:71"/>that feeds it ſelfe is able to live,<note place="margin">Joh. 6, 35. explained,</note>

Or in prayer, or in any other duty that you take in hand, doe you feed upon Chriſt in it? If you feed upon him there, you have life, and <hi>he that feeds not, lives not;</hi> if a man forbeare his meat he cannot long ſubſiſt. It is true, a man may live for a while and finde no relliſh in any thing, but in time he muſt finde reliſh in them, elſe he cannot be preſerved.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall I know that I doe feed upon Chriſt in every Ordinance?</hi>

               <note place="margin">1. A ſoule longs after Chriſt in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> Firſt, Whether doe you finde an inward longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in your ſouls after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the duties you goe about? Doe you come with a deſire to finde Chriſt in his Ordinance, hungring and thirſting, and not ſatisfied unleſſe you finde Chriſt? that is the nature of hungring and thirſting and ſo is the caſe here. This deſire and thirſt is ſuch an unquenchable deſire, as that without Chriſt it is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:117852:71"/>by no meanes ſatisfied; doe you therefore finde an inward longing to find and meet with the Lord Jeſus, in the Word that you read or heare, in the Sacraments that you receive, and ſuch a longing deſire, as that if you finde not Chriſt there, you goe away poore and dead, and finding your hearts unſatisfied is an evident ſigne of life, for you came to an Ordinance, and deſired to finde Chriſt there, and there he was not; what then, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. to the <hi>bed</hi> of the Ordinances, the Church goes to ſeek and to finde Chriſt, <hi>by night I ſought him,</hi> that was in a time of calamity, that ſhe could plainly diſcerne ſhe found him not, and ſhe ſought him in every other Ordinance, but found him not, or ſign of life; ſhe hungers, and ſought out after him, but could not finde him, and when ſhe miſſed him was not ſatisfied.</p>

            <p>Secondly, feeding hath another worke,<note place="margin">Strength and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> the former is but a preparation, or ſuppoſition of feeding, but a man alſo then feeds when he findes ſome ſweetneſſe, and relliſh in the meat that he eates, that doth ever accompany feeding, and is a ſigne that a man doth feed, the ſtomach doth well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the meat it feeds on; have you then found ſome ſweet relliſh in the Ordinances, <hi>the Goſpell is a ſweet ſavour to them that are ſaved,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.15, 16. and as for ſavour to ſmell, ſo, as a ſweet ſavour to the taſte; doe you therefore finde ſome kinde of <hi>ſweetneſſe,</hi> a ſpirituall <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> in the Word you heare, or read, or Sacraments you receive, or prayers that you make? Are they ſuch a comfort or ſweetneſſe to you, that you finde in this or that promiſe, or commandement, or doctrin, any word of life? Do you finde ſtrength, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it? It is an evident ſigne of life, becauſe you finde <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> in it, its a ſigne of health to relliſh a ſweetneſſe in our meat; for a ſick man, it may be, eates, and drinkes, but he findes no ſweetneſſe in it, and that is a part of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:117852:72"/>that he cannot reliſh his meat, and it is true, it may be a man that hath ſome life in him, feels no reliſh, no ſavour in any Ordinance; but then he ſees he is ſicke, and he complaines of it to God, but yet notwithſtanding if a man doe finde ſweetneſſe, and reliſh there, it is an evident argument not of life only, but of health, and ſuch as will maintaine ſpiritual life; but if a man find no ſweetneſſe in it he cannot live, for were there life, it would finde ſweetneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the Word.</note> in all feeding, there is a taking of the meate downe, and not ſpitting it out, but we receive it downe, and there it lyes in our ſtomachs, and we chew upon it, and there it reſts, but if we caſt it up againe, then we feed not; it is an ill ſigne when we caſt it away as ſoone as we receive it. If Gods Word <hi>abide with us,</hi> and in us, that we doe not reject it, but <hi>hide it in our hearts,</hi> that ſo <hi>we might not ſinne againſt God,</hi> Pſal. 119.11. and receive it by a wiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of it to our owne ſoules, receive it into the inward man, and apply our ſelves to every duty commanded us, ſo farre as concernes our callings, and our eſtates, and takes notice of every threatning, that we had need looke to it, ſo farre as we might ſinne againſt God; if we thus take the Word of God downe into our hearts, and make it our owne caſe, and therefore keepe it within our ſelves, and give up our ſelves in ſome meaſure to be bowed by it, and hide it in our hearts, and lets it ſit next our hearts, then truly we doe feed upon it, and it ſecretly conveyes ſtrength into us, though ſometimes we leſſe diſcerne it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Word in everything</note> all feeding containes in it a converſion of the meat into the thing nouriſhed, ſo as that which we feed upon, it becomes our ſelves, it is all one with our ſelves; in time it is ſo digeſted, and turned into our nature, that every part hath ſucked in its owne nouriſhment, every part hath received ſomething of that which was inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. This hath been anciently obſerved, this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then receiving Chriſt by faith, for when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply every word to our ſelves, and make Chriſt ours, that is receiving him to be ours; yet it is a further worke to be conformable to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in every thing, to be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:117852:72"/>confirmed and eſtabliſhed in the Promiſes, and to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them, to be terrified by threatnings, and to ſtand in awe of every word of God, and to be bowed to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubjection to Chriſt, day by day, by the word we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; this is a further mighty worke of grace:</p>
            <p>If therefore hee be a Chriſtian, that by the Word and Ordinances he receives, he is faſhioned and made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Chriſt; meek, and righteous, and lowly, and holy as he is, and willing to do any good Office for the Church of God, and goe up and down doing good, and needs no further motion this way, but as Chriſt moves him, it is a ſigne that he feeds upon Chriſt. Chriſt is turned into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or which is more, his nature, is rather turned into the nature of Chriſt; the nouriſhment being ſo ſtrong makes us become <hi>ſuch as he is in this world.</hi> Now when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by the Ordinances that we partake in, it is an evident ſign that we there feed upon him: And therefore try your ſelves by this ſigne of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if you live, you <hi>feed on Chriſt,</hi> and except you ſo doe, you have no <hi>life in you,</hi> ſo then conſider, do I feed upon <hi>the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his blood,</hi> and do I finde a ſpirituall appetite to the Lord Jeſus raiſed up in my ſoule? and do I find any ſpiritual refreſhment and ſtrength by that which I do partake in? and that which I ſo find ſweetneſſe in, I apply it to my own eſtate, and convey it into the inward part of my heart, that I may be able to drink it up as my lot and portion: And do I by this ſtrength of grace grow like to Chriſt? and do I more adorn <hi>the Goſpell of Chriſt?</hi> this is an evident ſigne you live, for you feed upon ſpirituall food, which is an argument of ſpiritual life; no man can feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpirituall food, but he that lives, and ſuch a life as hee lives in Chriſt: Let a man come to the Word without an appetite to it, and when he comes find no nouriſhment nor refreſhment in it, and applyes nothing as is ſaid to him; but let ſuch and ſuch looke to it, he never hears profitably, that doth not particularly apply that which he heares; and if he apply it, he rather ſtormes at it, it is an evident argument that ſuch a man hath no life in him at all. Not that you
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:117852:73"/>ſhould here look at the naturall body and blood of Chriſt, for that were a Canaball eating and drinking. That which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> puts upon the Church of God at this day; but our Saviour tells you the meaning of this place, <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing;</hi> had a company of <hi>Roman Souldiers</hi> fallen upon Chriſt, and either out of wrath againſt him, or love to themſelves, had pulled him in peeces and eaten him, goblet by goblet, it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted them nothing; had men eaten the reall body of Chriſt and drunk up his blood, and joyned with others in ſo doing, and left none of him, al this had profited them nothing, nay, it profits nothing, for the <hi>Capernites</hi> aske the queſtion, <hi>How can this man give us his fleſh to eat? it is an hard ſaying,</hi> they thought it incredible, <hi>v.</hi> 5.2. they would think it a ſavage bruitiſhneſſe to fal upon him in that manner, and therefore our Saviour ſo confeſſeth, that it is no part of his meaning, that they ſhould eate and drinke his reall body and blood: but hee meanes the breathing of the ſpirit in the Ordinances, if you can relliſh,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> and feed upon that; and grow to be ſuch as Chriſt was in this world, that was the meate and drinke of his ſoule, if you grow humble and meek, and be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the ſpirit of Chriſt, if you ſee your ſpirits confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the will of Chriſt, it is a ſigne of the life of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in your ſoules, which God hath given you through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A third effect of the life of ſanctification,<note place="margin">3 Signe</note> is growth, for that which lives, growes till it come to its full perfection, so in all naturall,<note place="margin">Growth in grace.</note> vegitative, or ſenſitive life; if it live, it growes, till it come to its full maturity, when it comes to its full vigour and ſtrength, it may decay and ſtand at a ſtay; but a Chriſtians life never comes to that, till it come to the life of glory, to the full meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt: In this life we cannot come to that, but therefore it is that we grow to the end of our dayes, and then are forthwith tranſlated to immortallity, <hi>ye deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>grow in grace:</hi> and God hath given us Miniſters to teach and inſtruct us, <hi>till we all grow to be perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 4.11, 12, 13. Col. 2.19.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:117852:73"/>
               <hi>Increaſe with the increaſings of God,</hi> with divine and inlarged and ſpirituall increaſing, ſo doth the body of Chriſt grow, and all the members of it: they <hi>grow in grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this is a third effect of life, if a man can find his heart to grow.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But doth not many a Chriſtian ſtand at a ſtay, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grow backward, and fall from their firſt love, fall from the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe and goodneſſe, and rootedneſſe in Chriſt, though not wholly cut off, yet falling from the firmeneſſe in grace, and the power of grace, and from fruitfullneſſe, and the abundance of the worke of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, many a ſoule doth ſo for a while, but if ſo bee, that God doe give a Chriſtian man, not to grow, we muſt not say therefore he doth not live, not but that a man for a time, may be weake; as a living man in ſickneſſe may be very weake, his ſpirit faile, and his ſtrength faile, and his worke and imployment fails him, and he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither eate, nor drink, no not ſo much as leane up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtaffe, but may lye bed-rid, but yet ſuch a man feeles a ſenſible diſtemper of his body, and he ceaſeth not to uſe the beſt means he can, and ſo in the end he comes to grow and recovers his firſt love againe in ſome meaſure; ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there are, that by ſinfull luſts waſte, inſtead of growing, as a theefe in a candle waſts it, but if there be a theefe in the heart, a lurking luſt in the ſoule; a living ſoule is not well till it be removed, by ſome good means or other, that ſo it may recover it ſelfe. It is ſometimes the caſe of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, Pſal. 39. ult. <hi>Oh ſpare a little that I may recover any ſtrength;</hi> ſo a Chriſtian man if he find himſelfe in a decay, that he is dead and heartleſſe in every ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, oh then ſpare a little, that I may recover my ſtrength: Now hee is afraid to dye in ſuch a caſe, but hee would now have ſome time, that he may recover his firſt love and his firſt fruits, and that his faith might not vaniſh away in aſhes and ſmoak, if he ſee that his ſpirit decayes, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then, <hi>whence he is fallen,</hi> Rev. 2.4.5. <hi>and repents, and doth his firſt workes:</hi> This is the nature of repentance, it purges
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:117852:74"/>out;<note place="margin">Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the beſt purge</note> it purges out the noyſome humours that brought the body into languiſh and decay. Repentance is the cheifeſt purge, and ſo then wee doe our firſt workes, and attain to our firſt love, and grow more at the laſt then at the firſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19. and therefore this is to be conſidered of, a Chriſtian man is a growing man, if not always in the bulke, which is eaſie to bee diſcerned, as to grow in ſtrength and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſurely he growes to more ſweetneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. An Apple is ſometimes grown to full growth upon a tree, yet grows not ſweet till a good time after, but in time it will: So a Chriſtian, though it may be he ſhall never get more knowledg then he hath, or more ability, but though the caſe ſo ſtand,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that you are like to grow no further; yet you may grow to more ſweetneſſe, and mellowneſſe, to more love to your brethren, and be more ready to deny your ſelves of that arrogancy of ſpirit, and pride he is now addicted to. And ſo a Chriſtian <hi>growes in ſweetneſſe, and growes in roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe of ſpirit,</hi> and ſees his more want of Chriſt, and gets faſter hold on Chriſt. And though he cannot grow more tall in his outward expreſſion, nor more painful; yet in theſe two no Chriſtian that growes, but if he be living ahd healthful, he growes in firmeneſſe and rootedneſſe in Chriſt, and in great dependance upon him, from day to day in his wayes, And he growes in more ſweetneſſe, aymes more at Gods glory, and is more in love to his brethren, and more denys himſelfe in his own matters.</p>
            <p>And if he grow not here, he is either no living Chriſtian in truth, or no healthfull Chriſtian; and if a man ſee this, and not bewaile his not growing in theſe, he hath no life at all in him; a man that growes harſh, and unſavoury and doth not take a courſe to repent of it, its a thouſand to one there is no life at all in him, but if a man grow, though but in amiableneſſe, and ſelfe-denial, and more firmly in Chriſt, and more aſſured of Gods grace and mercy, and more depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt for what he doth, and can do nothing without Chriſt, and he knowes it by experience, that unleſſe a man ſo grow, there is no life in him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Effect of the life of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> another effect of the life of ſanctification is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:117852:74"/>this, life is ſuch a thing as hath an expulſive power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and drive out of the body that which is noyſome and hurtfull to it, and will caſt and ſweat it out; Nature cannot endure to be clogged with ſuperfluity, out it muſt one way or other, Nature will eaſe it ſelfe, it cannot long ſubſiſt; paine and ſickneſſe is grievous, and painfull to Nature; if any thing trouble the ſtomach, or the body, out it muſt by vomit, or purge, it cannot ſtay if the man be living; ſo if grace be but living in the ſoule, there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive power in the ſoule, that will purge away that which is contrary to it, it cannot endure ſuperfluity, but away it muſt goe, there it cannot ſtay, nothing will he keep, but that which is convenient for him: A Chriſtian, looke whatſoever it be that a Chriſtian findes ſuperfluous, and findes contrary to the life of Chriſt in his ſoule, either too much, or contrary to his ſpirit, that he abandons it more or leſſe by degrees, meaſure after meaſure, and time after time; ſo the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Lay apart all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe and ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe,</hi> &amp;c. If there be any thing which is <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi> or <hi>filthy,</hi> away with it, let it not reſt there; and if it be for no good purpoſe, let it have no reſt in thee.</p>
            <p>There is many parts of knowledge that is not contrary to the life of ſanctification, but are more then we ſhall have uſe of in our callings, and though they may be ſuch things as others may make uſe of, yet they are ſuperfluous when they are of no uſe to us in our callings, then put them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unleſſe they be of uſe either for neceſſity, or expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, then nature will caſt them away, eſpecially if they be naughty things; they are more then ſuperfluous, then they are noyſome and hurtfull; and therefore a Chriſtian man principally caſts away that which is noyſome, and corrupt; both <hi>doubting</hi> and <hi>preſumption</hi> is contrary to the life of faith, and therefore muſt be caſt out, caſt out all feares, and all ſelfe confidence, <hi>Perfect love caſteth out feare,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. Faith ſtrives againſt feare, and love ſtrives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt malice, and patience ſtrives againſt frowardneſſe, modeſty againſt pride, and ſo every of God; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:117852:75"/>to ſee how it will by the degrees either ſweat them out, or elſe ſet themſelves by ſome ſerious duties of humiliation, and ſo <hi>cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. that he may <hi>grow to perfect holineſſe in the feare of God.</hi> He is weary of it, and that life of grace caſts out all the life of ſinne; he lookes at the life of this world as ſomething in it that is good, yet ſo much of the world as he ſees he cannot well manage, but with cumberance to the Spirit of grace, he layes it aſide, and meddles not with it, he ſtudies no more then to uſe in a practicall life; he would live as <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour, when he ſees it troubles him he layes it aſide. So ſhall you finde it with a Chriſtian, theſe things are unprofitable for him; keepe them out of your ſoules leaſt they prove a ſnare to you, and whatever is ſuperfluity caſt it out, and whatever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts you, and clogs you with cares, out with it; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is a burden to the life of grace, caſt out all ſuch things.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5 Signe, life propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates its like.</note> The laſt act of the life of ſanctification is the begetting of the like, and propagating according to their kinde; it is the nature both of Spirituall and Naturall life, it propagates its kinde, though at the firſt it may be weake, yet it growes to that temper by which it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate, and the life of grace is moſt ſtrong in this regard, it no ſooner moves and feeds, or growes in any meaſure, or begins to expell any ill matter, but it will have a minde to be fruitfull begetting its kinde, and that is above natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life; a Chriſtian is moſt apt and ready to draw on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be like himſelfe. As ſoone as ever the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaw that Jeſus was indeed the Meſſiah, and found, true ſweetneſſe in him, the very ſame houre ſhe runs into the Towne, and tells her neighbours, <hi>Come ſee a man that hath told me all that ever I did,</hi> (Joh. 4.29.) <hi>Is not he the Chriſt?</hi> and when they came and ſaw it they ſaid, <hi>We beleeve, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy Word, but becauſe we have heard him our ſelves, and we know that this is indeed the Chriſt.</hi> This is the proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true life, as ſoone as they are truly begotten, they beget others of their owne kinde, not but that ſometimes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:117852:75"/>a Chriſtian ſoule hides himſelfe long, before he be well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but when he truly diſcernes that he lives, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelfe that God will be gracious to his ſoule, then he deſires to propagate the like grace unto others, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.41. to 46. when one had found Chriſt, they call o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to come and ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10, <hi>Then ſhall I teach tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors thy wayes, and ſinners ſhall be converted to thee;</hi> to ſhew you, that if God will but worke <hi>a cleane heart</hi> in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>renew a right ſpirit within him;</hi> and his <hi>broken bones</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and if God ſhall be pleaſed to <hi>eſtabliſh him with his free ſpirit,</hi> and he may be once againe aſſured of the pardon his ſins; then <hi>will he teach others the wayes of God:</hi> if he be once converted himſelfe, he will draw on as many others as he can. Thus you have five ſignes of ſpirituall life.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now in the next place to ſee how we may diſcerne life by the properties, and adjuncts of it; you heard before of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of life, now of the properties and qualities of this life, by diſcerning of which we may know that we have life.</p>
            <p>There be three properties or qualities of life.<note place="margin">Three properties of life. 1. Warmth</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, where ever there is life, there is ſome warmth, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.34. when the Prophet had laine upon the childe, and had done ſo ſeven times, at length the breath of the childe began to wax warme, a ſigne that life was a reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and thereby the Prophet diſcerned that life began to returne into the body of the childe, becauſe warmth retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and ſo is the preſence of the Spirit of grace, and the union of it with the ſoule and body of a man, it makes a man fervent, and warme; <hi>Fervent in ſpirit.</hi> Rom. 12.11 and therefore it is that it is reſembled unto fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11 <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come downe upon you, as it were with fiery tongues,</hi> and ſhall warme and heate you, with whatever du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties God ſhall call you to, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Quench not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> now quenching belongs to fire, a ſigne therefore that the ſpirit is of a fervent nature, ſo farre forth as it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any quenching and deſtroying by the Sons of men, and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Stirre up the gifts of grace in you;</hi> as if yee ſtirred up the embers of the fire, ſo ſtirre up, and kindle the gifts of God which is in you, blow them up into a kindling
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:117852:76"/>flame, ſo that all theſe things expreſſe thus much: That ſince the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus and from him, communicated to his Members is a ſpirit of heat, therefore whereſoever there is warmth there is life, if no warmth, nor heat, there is no life; and as our ſpirits begin to wax warme, ſo we grow to life in Chriſtianity. Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is that expreſſion in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.22. <hi>Did not our hearts burne within us, while he talked with us of the Scriptures?</hi> to ſhew you, that there is a power in the Word, to convey ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Spirit of grace to the Hearers, as that their hearts begin to glow within them, and to convey ſome heat and warmth into them, when the Word is powerfully applyed to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>For the further opening of this point, you ſhall ſee it in ſome things principally, which are ever found in ſome meaſure in the ſpirits of Chriſtian men that have any life in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>First, that which is wonderfull, and is indeed no where found but in them, their very knowledge is warme,<note place="margin">Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge warme</note> which in all other men is cold; knowledge is but an empty ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, brings forth no great matter of heat; but in a Chriſtian, his knowledge is full of heat, <hi>Zeale muſt be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge,</hi> knowledge is no knowledge without zeal, and zeale is but a wilde-fire without knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. So if Chriſtians have a knowledge of God, but no zeale, there is no ſaving life in that knowledge, it is not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods people. Notable is that ſpeech of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.35. (ſpeaking of <hi>John</hi>) <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining light,</hi> not only <hi>a ſhining light</hi> to give cleare inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the knowledge of the Meſſiah, and the true meaning of the Law, but withall <hi>a burning light;</hi>

                  </gap>
               </note> ſo as that he had a notable power when Hypocrites came before him to burne them up, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. And ſo where ever he came he did not only ſhew them what they ſhould doe, what ſhall we Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans doe, and what ſhal we Souldiers doe? <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3. to 15. but he did burne up not only thoſe who were profeſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the wayes of grace, but all thoſe that he found in Hypocriſie he burnt them all up where ever he came,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:117852:77"/>and if he did not finde out their luſts, he would kindle a fire in them; he warmed <hi>Herod</hi> in ſuch ſort, as that he was conſtrained to doe many things, according to <hi>Johns</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. and ſo ſhall you finde it in all the Servants of God, that according to their life, if there be true life, there is true burning, though ſometimes their burning is not ſo ſtrong as their life, yet there is heat and fervency of ſpirit mixed with their knowledge, that if they know the Will of God they are inflamed, and their knowledge of Chriſt will not ſuffer them to <hi>be barren and unfruitfull,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. So that the knowledge which a Chriſtian man hath is ſuch, as by which he will doe what he ought to doe; if he ſee ſinne in his brother he will not ſuffer it to lye there, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. If he ſee any thing amiſſe in his brother that he ſees not in himſelfe, he will be helpfull to him; where the Spirit of grace is lively, they will not ſuffer their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to reſt in ſinne, much leſſe themſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is the warmth of this knowledge, it both burnes up their owne luſts like chaffe, and all the ſinfull diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that we ſee in the lives and wayes of our Brethren; this is one part of the heat of a Chriſtian ſoule, that his knowledge is a warme knowledge; Look what he knowes he thinkes he muſt doe, whereas another man knowes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, but he doth them not; but a Chriſtian, if he know it to be the Will of God he muſt doe it. And that is the reaſon why Gods ſervants are many times counted very buſie, as indeed the fire is ever very buſily working, no creature in the houſe ſo buſie as the fire is; and ſo the knowledge of Gods people makes them to be ſo buſie in doing, and therein they expreſſe the life of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Where there is life there is breath.</note> where ever is true life there is this warmth, a warmth in their breath, both in the Naturall and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall body; in this Naturall body, while we live it is warme, and ſo long as we live we breath more or leſſe, it is but for a little time, if at all, breath be intercepted, it may be in ſome ſuddaine fits, but ordinarily if it tarry long it is a ſigne of death; but if there be life there is breathing, and that breathing is warme, ſome warme breath comes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:117852:77"/>from him that is alive. And truely ſo ſhall you finde it in your ſpirituall life.</p>
            <p>If there be any true life in the heart of a Chriſtian ſoule, there is alwayes ſome kind of warm breathing, there is ſome meaſures of warmth in his prayers; the prayers of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite ir alwayes but lip-labour, and accordingly luſt labor, the words vaniſh away in the aire, but there is ever more or leſſe ſome kind of warmth-in the prayers of Gods ſervants, according to what the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. even then when we <hi>know not what to pray for, nor how to pray as we ought then the ſpirit helpes our infirmities,</hi> that when we ſometimes cannot bring out a word to God, the heart is ful ſometimes of anguiſh, and diſcouragement in reſpect of inward deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or temptations, and outward afflictions, but yet though in ſuch a caſe we be not able to tel what to pray for, yet there is ever in a Chriſtian ſoule ſomething that makes him ſeeke to God, and the very ſighs of ſuch a ſoule, come from ome warmeth of ſpirit within him. The <hi>ſcalding ſighs</hi> and <hi>deep groanes of the ſoule,</hi> they come from a ſpirit of life, and warmth in Chriſt Jeſus: Therefore though it be true, there be many cold prayers, that Gods ſervants do put up, yet there is ſome kind of ſighs and groans that ſprings from them, which argues ſome heat and life in them.</p>
            <p>And ſo is it, As they breath thus to God-ward, ſo doe they breath one to another; ſo that if they ſpeake of the things of God, they ſpeake not of God, and his Word lightly, and wantonly, or looſely, as thoſe that have no affection to them; but if they ſpeak of the Word of God, of his threatnings, promiſes, or of any of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or any of the workes of his providence, they ſpeake not of them coldly, as thoſe that took no pleaſure in them, but if they ſpeake of any of the things of God, they ſpeake with ſome reverence, and deſire after them, and ſettling a confirmation in them: they have love to the word, and rejoyce in it, and ſtand in awe, and in feare of it, and they exerciſe their hearts and wits about it, when at any time they ſpeak of the things of God, ſo that there is ſome kind of warmth in the expreſſion of a Chirſtian in ſome ſavoury affection, whereby he eſteemes of the things
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:117852:78"/>of God, above what is found in an hypocrite.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Spiritual warmth digeſteth Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</note> There is a certaine kind of warmth, by which the ſoule doth not only affect the Ordinances of God, but by which it doth in ſome meaſure digeſt them; there is no living man wanting ſome ſuch meaſure of heat as makes him able to digeſt ſome kind of dyet, though not alwayes ſtrong meate, eſpecially, if he be in any meaſure of health, and that is no ſmall meaſure of heate, Pſal. 119.20. <hi>the very longing deſire, it alwayes hath to Gods Judgements,</hi> was it that even made his ſoule to breake within him, and ſo to pant after Gods Word, and his preſence in his Ordinances, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 42.1. there was a kind of panting, and longing, and eager deſire after God, by which it comes to paſſe that the ſoule of a Chriſtian cloſes with God in his Ordinances, and turnes them into nouriſhment within himſelfe, and ſo is more ſtrongly, and inwardly bent towards God in the ways of his grace, whereas a dead ſpirit is flat, and hath no affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the word, no affection to Gods preſence, no liſt to the things of this nature.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, things that are warm put them, together and they are the more warm,<note place="margin">4. Spiritual warmth heateth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> but put cold clogs, and peeces of wood together, and they are never a whit the warmer, but if you take but two or three of them things that are well kindled, and they will ſet all a fire that comes nigh them, though ready before to goe out for want of ſupply, if you lay two or three warme brands together, they will kindle one another. And truly ſo it is among Chriſtians, take you a Chriſtian, that hath this ſpirituall warmth in him, though almoſt benumbed for want of good company, and good conference, and breathing forth of Gods ſpirit and grace in the ſoule. Yet if he meet with two or three like himſelfe, they preſntly begin to kindle one another; And the breath of ſuch Chriſtians, is like bellows, to blow up ſparkes ſavoury and ſweet expreſſions of their hearts, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves by their mutuall fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Yea, and ſometimes they grow ſo warme by this means,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:117852:78"/>as that they are fit to admoniſh one another, to exhort, and to comfort, and if need require, to rebuke one another, as occaſion ſerves, 1 Pet. 4.8. <hi>Have fervent love one to another, above all things have fervent love among your ſelves,</hi> this is a ſpeciall thing: love among Chriſtians, by which love they ſo kindle one another, to ſuch deep reſpects to God, and the wayes of his grace, and ſo burne one out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much ſinfull folly and frailety which will be in them, that are ſo looſe one to another, and raiſeth them up to that power of godlineſſe, which ſometimes they had grown up unto, and now almoſt loſt for want of often joyning together, for by ſo doing, they do what they can to put out the fire; when Satan means to put out the light and life of Religion, out of both Church and Commonwealth, hee layes one Chriſtian in one corner, and another in another, that they ſhall, when they liſt, go to bed, and ſleep, and then a lazy ſpirit ſhall come upon them, and ſo they lye, till they be dead in treſpaſſes and ſins: But above all things, have fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love among your ſelves, <hi>forſake not the fellowſhip you have one with another, as the manner of ſome is,</hi> Heb. 10.25, 26. <hi>Love covereth a multitude of ſins.</hi> So as that though there was much evill in Chriſtians before, yet their very lying together, doth burn out all that ſuperfluity of naughty ſtuffe that hangs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſervants of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>ſee that ye love one another with a pure heart, and fervency of ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This warmth in Chriſtians, it is found in theſe foure things. And thus you ſee the properties of this life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>You ſay, but if this were always found in Chriſtian men, how comes it to paſſe then, that the ſervants of God do many times finde their hearts ſo cold in their prayers, and appetite ſo little to the word, and ſo unprofitable under it? How ſhould a man heare ſo much and profit ſo little, if a man aid digeſt the word? and is it not a common complaint of Chriſtians? how much they hear and how little they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit? Yea, and will not ſome Chriſtians ſay, he profits nothing at all, no not any thing? And is it ſo many times, that Chriſtians come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they are little edification one to another, very little profit? ſit together, and talke of matters, that little edifie, but rather corrupt the ſpirits one of another? how is it then that you ſay, where ever there is life there is heat? ſo ſuch as makes them more lively in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:117852:79"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>And it might be objected,</hi> that Luke 24.32. Did not our hearts burn within us, &amp;c. <hi>A ſign that till he came to them, and came into conference with them, and did rub them up, they were very cold hearted, and dull ſpirited, and went on their way with much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſoule, without life and ſtrength of ſoule, until he came to put life into their ſpirits?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, many times, Gods ſervants, are very cold and benumbed, and a cold ſpirit growes upon them excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,) ſo as that they ſcarce feele any life breathing in their knowledge, or prayers, or appetites to the Word, or love to their Brethren, little warmth in any of theſe, partly through want of ſupplying the life of Gods grace, with fit nouriſhment, whereby the heart ſhould grow warme. As naturall fire, if it be not ſupplyed with new fewell it will goe out, and partly ſometimes, by pouring cold water upon it; which is as much as in us lyes to dampe the fire. And we doe power cold water upon this life of grace, when we admit of any ſinfull luſts in our ſoules, thoſe do marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly eate out all that life, and heate of ſpirit that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we had in our hearts, and ſometimes by an exceſſive uſe of worldly things, which without a very ſpiritual mind doth clog the ſoule, as much as if you ſhould throw cold water upon a fire, it will damp it very much; ſo is this caſe, men ſometimes walke in worldly buſineſſes, with worldly affections; and ſometimes give leave to diſtempered luſts, and ſometimes neglect to put any fewell to the fire of grace, but as ſoone as ever they find the heart well warmed with ſome good Sermon, or a good Prayer, or Conference, or the like, they thinke this fire wil never goe out, and ſo they begin to neglect it, and ſo either the fire goes quit out, or elſe is ſo damped, as that you can diſcerne no life, no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or power of Religion there: And therefore ſuch a thing may befall Gods ſervants, they may grow dul hearted one way or other, as you have heard. But yet thus much let me ſay, though this ſometimes do befal the ſpirits of Gods people, yet even then, when they want burning and chafeing, and stirring up, there is ſomething in them, that argues ſome life, and where is ſome life, there is ſome heat, ſo much life as there is, ſo much heat is there, ſo much
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:117852:79"/>as you take away of your Chriſtian heat, ſo much life you take away: And therefore for theſe two Diſciples, that went to <hi>Emaius.</hi> It is ſaid, when they <hi>were talking one with another,</hi> they were talking of Jeſus Chriſt, and upon all the things that befell him in his paſſion. And ſaid Chriſt to them, ver. 17. <hi>What manner of communication is this,</hi> and what is the matter that you are thus ſad? what was it, that made them ſad? was it not an affection of griefe for all the evills done to their Saviour, that was life of grace, and ſome heate there was in them that their ſpirits ſhould be ſo troubled, to ſee their Elders and Princes, and all the people to cry out ſo bitterly againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and not to leave him till they had crucified him, there was ſome ſad expreſſion came from them, upon that occaſion. And ſo, though it left the outward man ſad, yet there was ſomething in the heart; though full of doubting through unbeleife, what this Chriſt was, and what this would come to, <hi>we hoped this was he that ſhould redeem Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> then Chriſt began to put a little warmth into them, by ſaying, <hi>ought not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe things? v.</hi> 24, 25. and ſo <hi>he opens to them the Scriptures</hi> ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of himſelfe, and theſe words put new life into them, and did blow up the ſpirit and heat of that decaying life, which was overwhelmed with griefe and care, their hearts was heated yet. So that take you a Chriſtian man when he is even in the moſt diſordered framelook how much he hath loſt of his ſpiritual heat, ſo much of his true life; if he have left to be warm, ſo much life hath he loſt, and if his warmth be ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, his life is ſmoothered for the preſent.</p>
            <p>And even as life will ſhew it ſelfe, in the very ſad face of the heart, and dejection of ſpirit that they fall into, and ſometimes in the deepe ſighs and groans of the heart, which in ſuch a caſe it ſometimes will breake forth into. So a Chriſtian ſoule when his heate is moſt damped, there is a ſad face in his ſpirit, that he diſcerns all is not well with him, his ſpirit is benumbed, &amp; his heart in his own thoughts is frozen within him. It is a burden to him, and a matter of ſadneſſe to his ſpirit, and therefore hee doth expreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſometimes with many ſad and deep ſighs and groanes,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:117852:80"/>about his forlorne and loſt eſtate, and yet ſometimes you ſhall have his heart, even then when his heart is moſt cold (which is worſe then the former) for you ſhall ſometimes have a Chriſtian ſoule, not onely not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſadneſſe,<note place="margin">

                  </gap> this.</note> when his life is ſmothered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, but vaniſh away in much empty carnall delights, and contentments, and rejoycing in thoſe comforts which have no life at all in them. A Chriſtian man that hath his life ſo deaded, may come not onely to have nothing left, but ſadneſſe of heart to behold it, but hee may looſe his ſadneſſe too, and even that vaniſh away in outward rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, ſo as no life in his heart, in a manner, is left. <hi>Peter</hi> when he had denyed his Maſter, his heart was much oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within him, he was pricked and wounded with anguiſh in his ſoul, but there was ſome life in that. But what was it with <hi>David</hi> after his committing of uncleanneſſe nine or ten <hi>months together?</hi> he pleaſeth himſelfe in his pleaſures, and delights, and contentments which his royalty put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and made <hi>Vriah drunke,</hi> and did eate and drink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe liberally with him: and in the end put him to death, and that very ſleightly, and when he heares of it, makes no matter of it, <hi>but the ſword devoures one, as well as another:</hi> and had not his pulſe beating in him, no warme breath comes from him, but an empty flouriſh, and outward joyallity as if he had ſung all care away, and all fear of God out of his heart. As if there was no ſpirituall affection left in his heart of the eſtate of the whole Church of God, whereas his poore ſervant could ſay unto him, <hi>ſhall I goe home and ſollace my ſelf with my wife and children,</hi> the caſe ſtanding with the Church ſo as it doth, he would not do ſo, a word that one would have thought, would have warmed a good mans heart, but he was not warmed with it, nor with any lively affection, not any beating of his pulſe to Chriſtianity, nothing ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but a ſwounding of the whole man, that he that had ſeen <hi>David</hi> in ſuch a caſe, and had never known him before, he might have written in his forehead, a man forſaken of God and void of all feare of his name, had he ſeen him in this caſe, Where was then <hi>Davids</hi> life all this while? It
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:117852:80"/>was a fearefull condition, and of all we read in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, none ſo farre forſaken, whoſe whole ſpirit was ſo farre benumbed as <hi>Davids</hi> then was? and yet truly life there was ſtil in him; I doubt not though all this while you ſhal ſee that either <hi>David</hi> prayed not all this while, and that hath been the caſe ſometimes of right godly men, that have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not of three yeares together made a private Prayer in their Cloſets, have been content to come to duties in the Family, &amp; cauſe others to perform duties, but for their own parts further then a form of religion, or ſhame, or ſatisfying of conſcience forces them, they let all reſt, no affection at all to the duty; they know God tooke no pleaſure in ſuch a ſoule while they lived in ſuch a courſe, and ſo would they lye many moneths, and yeares, and all that while not ſo much as lift up a private prayer to God; and this is a far worſe caſe then the other, and yet even this ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls them, when as ſinfull luſts have ſo diſtempered the life of Chriſt in them; there is ſtill an habit of grace in the ſoule, but yet ſcarce any life of Religion putting forth it ſelfe, but ſtill where warmth is removed, ſo much life from holy duties is taken away.</p>
            <p>And another anſwer to this poynt is, that even as you ſee it is by the Almighty power of God that there may be fire, and not heat, as you ſee in the fiery Furnace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the three Children was caſt, though it was made <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hot,</hi> yet it had not power to hurt <hi>an haire of their heads,</hi> nor to ſwinge a lap of their Garments, the power of the ſire was propended by the mighty power of God; as there is this power in God concerning materiall fire, ſo is there a marvellous helliſh and Devilliſh power in ſinne, though not an Almighty power, yet very like to an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, that that which hath a mighty worke of God, by the Almighty power of his grace in the hearts of the Servants of God the work of an Almighty power.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch a venemous power in ſin as that it will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend all acts of grace,<note place="margin">Power of ſinne.</note> not ſo much as ſhew any act of grace in a Chriſtian ſoule, but the ſoule and all the graces in it ſhall lye as the body of a man in a ſwound, not any
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:117852:81"/>breathing, or ſight, or hearing, or motion, nothing to ſhew of any ſpirituall life; that if he ſhould continue ſo, you would conclude he were dead, only this kind of life of grace is there, you ſhall have thus much life in him: There is a kinde of unliſtineſſe and heavineſſe of ſoule, to act wickedneſſe with all that ſtrength and power, which ſometimes a godly man, while he was carnall, did reach forth his heart and hand unto, a kind of frame of ſpirit in a Chriſtian when it is at the worſt, though it can ſolace it ſelfe very farre in ſinne, and goes on hardening its heart in its owne way, moſt deſperately, and frowardly, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there was alwaies ſomething in his heart, that will not ſuffer his ſoule to breake out, with all that ſtrength of the ſpirit of wickedneſſe, as it did when it was carnall, and the reaſon of that is becauſe of that ſpeech, <hi>Gal</hi> 5.17. there is <hi>fleſh and ſpirit</hi> in that ſoule, ſo as neither can the ſpirit doe what it would, nor the fleſh what it would; take a Chriſtian when he is moſt ſtrong, and he cannot ſo glorifie God, nor ſo edifie his brethren as hee would, by reaſon of the body of ſinne; there is alwaies in the beſt of a Chriſtian, ſomething like the ſpots in the Moone, ſome darkneſſe in it, not a Chriſtian man; but when he is moſt lively in grace, but he hath ſome darkneſſe in his beſt performances; ſo when corruption is moſt ſtrong, and grace moſt feeble and weake; as in the former, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will weaken the beſt performances, ſo here corruption cannot carry a Chriſtian man to doe all that wickedneſſe, which elſe he would breake forth into; nor with that ſtrength and vigour which elſe he would put forth in it though he doe rejoyce in his wickedneſſe,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> and beare it out; yea out-face his very conſcience, and out-ſtare the very light of the graces of God within him, and goe on plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe in the hardneſſe of his owne heart, yet there is ſomething in the bottome that keeps poſſeſſion for God, and makes him goe about it bunglingly, it becomes him not, he cannot ſet it forth with a grace; <hi>David</hi> in his worſt, comes not off with full power of wickedneſſe, which elſe his corrupt heart would willingly break forth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:117852:81"/>into, were it not for the Spirit of grace that moves ſlowly in ſuch caſes as theſe be, ſo that ſtill the caſe ſtands cleare; how much life, ſo much warmth, and that warmth will expreſſe it ſelfe if any life be there at all.</p>
            <p>So that take a ſurvey of your owne eſtates, by this meanes you would know whether you have Chriſt or no, whether you have life, or no? If you have the life of grace, there is ſome ſpirituall warmth in thy ſoule, ſome heat in thy ſoule; doe but conſider then the knowledge that is within thee: Is thy knowledge ſuch as lets thee alone, and only puffes thee up, and makes thee to thinke goodly of thy ſelfe, if that be all the worke of thy knowledge, thou art a dead-hearted Chriſtian; if it cauſe thee to vaniſh away in empty contemplation, and thou therefore talkeſt, that thou mayeſt let others ſee thou haſt knowledge as well as others; and if it be dead, and cold, and empty, and vaniſh away in empty notion, and ſpeculation, and dead confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then thy knowledge is barren in goodneſſe, and that is an argument of no life in thy ſoule; but if there be any truth of life in thy ſoule, thy knowledge is warme and lively, thy knowledge that is in thee hath ſome zeale, and that ſets an edge upon it, and makes it ſerviceable to God and thy brethren. I know not better how to expreſſe it, then from <hi>Revel,</hi> 1.14, 15. in the deſcription of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, <hi>His eyes were as a flame of fire.</hi> It is true, the eye is lightſome, but it doth not burne, they are not hot, but the eyes of Chriſt is as a flaming heat; and the meaning is, Chriſt is deſcribed juſt according to the ſtate of the Church, to whom <hi>Iohn</hi> was to write, as he had <hi>feet of braſſe;</hi> when he writes to a Church, that though burned in the fire, yet the more you burne it, the leſſe it waſts, and the more pure it is, and by degrees the more bright; ſo where he ſpeakes to a Church in perſecution, and it is not conſumed, then Chriſt hath feet like braſſe; but if he write to a Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> a Church of a warme ſpirit, then, <hi>thus faith he that hath eyes like a flame of fire, Revel.</hi> 2.9. meaning the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that that Church had, which was full of zeale as wel as of light, and according to the meaſure of its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:117852:82"/>ſo it grew more in grace, and therefore the workes were more at the laſt then at the firſt. As their knowledge growes, ſo growes their zeal; ſo that if thou haſt that life in Chriſt which accompanies ſalvation, thy <hi>eyes are like a flame of fire,</hi> full of burning light, as well as brightſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Is thy knowledge ſuch as ſuffers thee to ſit downe barren, and though thou knoweſt that thou oughteſt to doe this and that, yet thou doeſt it not, then there is no heate and warmth in thy knowledge; but if there be true life and warmth in thy ſpirit, thy knowledge ſtirres thee up to be doing, and ſtirres up others to be doing alſo, and thy knowledge will not ſuffer thee to let them alone; juſt as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſometimes ſaid to the high Prieſts, <hi>We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſpeake that which we know, and have ſeene, and heard, Acts</hi> 4.18, 19, 20. And therefore though they threatned them is perrill of life, to ſpeake no more in Chriſts name, yet ſay they, that which we know to be the Truth of God, that we muſt needs ſpeake; as <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpeakes, chap. 20. <hi>I could not forbeare:</hi> The light that was in him was a glowing, and warme heate, and the Word of God in him, was as <hi>a mighty fire;</hi> and it will not ſuffer him to reſt, and he muſt alſo ſtir up others. So then, examine whether there be any heate in thy knowledge, if thy knowledge be not according to zeale, it will but aggravate thy condemnation.</p>
            <p>Againe, examine thy breath, whether doeſt thou breath or no? Doeſt thou ſmell a good ſavour in Gods Word, when thou doeſt read, or heare it? And doeſt thou ſmell a ſweet ſavour in the conference of Chriſtian men? or doth it ſtinke in thy noſtrils? if it be ſweet to thee it is well: Doeſt thou pray to God with ſome kinde of panting after him, and thy ſpirit is fit to faint within thee, and thou canſt ſit downe and bemoane thy ſelfe to God, that thou haſt ſo loſt thy ſelfe, then there is breath in thee; or canſt thou bring out a word to edifie thy brethren, it is well; but if there be no breath in thee it is an evident ſigne thou art dead, or at leaſt in a deep ſleep, if thou haſt no ability to pray, and can reliſh no ordinance of God, and have no kinde of aptneſſe to edifie another, then either there is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:117852:82"/>no life in thee, or elſe it is much benumbed, and therefore either no life, or none that is extant in thee; And ſo how doſt thou find thy warm affections ſtand to the Word? haſt thou a ſtomach to the Word? And haſt thou not ſo much profit by it, as to ſee thou doeſt not profit and art aſhamed of it; but if not, there is no life in thee. And if thou loveſt to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from thy brethren, &amp; you are never better then when you are falling off, and ſitting looſe from your brethren, if you love to be aſunder, there is no life in you, no life of Religion there, for Religion deſires to preſerve it ſelfe, and love is a principall worke of Religion, <hi>above all things have fervent love among your ſelves.</hi> A man had rather cover a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of wicked practiſes, then looſe the fervency of his love one towards another. And if therefore the Devill throw brands among you, and you fal aſunder; one Chriſtian hangs here and another there, in the end while you lye ſo a ſunder the fire goes out; and men may bid one another good night, and then may you all take your pleaſure in ſin, the truth is, then all the life of Religion goes out, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſineſſe in the Family drawes away, and ſo reſts till all the life be loſt. And therefore if you ſee men are willing to ſit looſe, and fall off one from another, then there is an end of the life and power of godlineſſe; a bidding of Religion good night. And no more profit to be had while ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of ſoule doth laſt. But if you ſee that men come together, as in that ancient famous Viſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. every <hi>bone</hi> finds out his fellow and <hi>joynes</hi> with him, and then there was a <hi>noiſe</hi> and a <hi>ſhaking,</hi> if you ſee <hi>bones gather, bone to his bone,</hi> then at the next <hi>prophecying</hi> fleſh will come, and <hi>ſinewes,</hi> and the next <hi>propheſie,</hi> will <hi>breath life into them,</hi> ſo if men begin to annex themſelves one unto another, as living brands; If one begin to ſeek out another, and to draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to lye cloſe together, if bone begin to gather to his bone, then there is hope of an Hoſt of armed men to ſtand up for God, in good ways; then there wil be life, and ſtrength, and power of godlineſſe; elſe make account of it, that in very truth there is no life; no power of Religion, where there is no reliſhing, no cloſing one with another, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee men cloſing together, and warming one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:117852:83"/>in the wayes of Gods grace, and there is ſome ſence of your owne unprofitableneſſe under the Word, and if you can digeſt it, turne it into edification of your ſelfe and others, then there is true life in you, and having life you have Chriſt, and in him <hi>you have life in aboundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two properties more of life,</p>
            <p>Where there is any life, there is ſome kind of plyable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Pliablenes of ſpirit.</note> whereas dead carcaſſes are cold and ſtiffe, and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury though never ſo ſweet before, this is a certain truth, the more you keep a dead corps above ground, the more it ſtinkes and is unſavoury; It ſhoots out at length, and you may ſooner breake him then bend him any way, but while he is alive you may bend him which way you will; now therefore conſider thus much, if there be any truth of grace in you, <hi>you are gentle and eaſie to be intreated,</hi> Jam. 3.17. but if not,<note place="margin">Jam. 3.17 expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> then you are of a ſtiffe ſpirit, inflexible and <hi>implacable,</hi> for to be gentle, and eaſie, is the true nature of life; but if not, then have you loſt your life; then either you never had life, or elſe it is a ſwound, and ſo evapoured that there is no bending or bowing of it, but they are fit to be buryed as a dead carcaſſe.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is this plyableneſſe, and eaſineſſe to be entreated, and on the contrary this ſtiffeneſſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is Foure things in eaſineſſe to bee intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Eaſie to be pleaſed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. any thing that you doe about them, is pleaſing to them, that is poynt of gentleneſſe; and a gracious man in whom is the life and power of godlineſſe, he is eaſie to be pleaſed. If you go about any thing, with any tollerable indeavour to give him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he is not hard to be pleaſed; and if not eaſie to pleaſe, there is little grace; or dangerous to be none at all, if you have much a do to bow or bend them to comply with them that asketh and thing of them, there is a dead heart in ſuch a ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A man that is eaſie to be intreated and gentle, if he be offended he is easie to be intreated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. It is a ſigne a man is of <hi>a reprobate ſence,</hi> when hee is <hi>implacable</hi> and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:117852:83"/>ſtiffe; when life is gone, a man is ſtiffe, not eaſie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If ſo be that hee have offended another man, he is eaſie to yeeld, and to acknowledge that he is in a wrong, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.4. There is in a living Chriſtian an aptneſſe to yeeld when he is in a wrong. If a man be in a wrong, and will not ſee his errour, will not ſee the evil hee hath done in Gods ſight, his ſtiffeneſſe is a ſigne of his dead-heartedneſſe; So much ſtiffeneſſe here, ſo much deadneſſe in his heart, and ſo much nearneſſe to the chambers of death: For a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian if he have offended he is willing to yeeld, and will acknowledge himſelfe a failer, and promiſe amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He is willing to deny himſelfe, of his owne right, even upon equall eaſie termes, to prevent an offence that may grow, and he ſtands upon equall termes, leaſt an offence ſhould ariſe, he yeelds and denies himſelfe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. So <hi>Abraham</hi> yeelded to <hi>Lot,</hi> though he had not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, yet hee condiſcended to his inferiour, and if any, <hi>Lot</hi> ſhal be the chooſer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.8. This gentleneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit argues life of Chriſt in the holy ſervants of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> was not ſtiffe, but gentle and eaſie to be pleaſed, when he was offended. Now therefore art thou eaſie to be pleaſed, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated to paſſe by a wrong? And if thou haſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another, thou wilt acknowledge it, and art eaſily wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny thy ſelfe to prevent offence, then thou art not ſtiffe; but art living Chriſtian; but if men be ſtiffe in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hard to be pleaſed, and froward, no man can give him content; as <hi>Naballs</hi> ſervants ſaid of him: And of we have offended hard to be intreated, and will by no meanes ſee it, or acknowledge it; and by no meanes yeeld, but turne our ſelves to endleſſe devices, and if we ſtand upon our owne ends, and wee will have our owne to the utmoſt farthing, and why ſhould we bend; then truly we are cold, and little power and life breathing in us.</p>
            <p>The laſt property of life is this.<note place="margin">So much ſweetness ſo much life.</note> The body while it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, is ſweet and ſavoury, but ſo ſoon as ever it begins to ſmell, it muſt be buryed, it cannot be kept above ground, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:117852:84"/>living Chriſtian is a ſweet ſavour to God, a <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. and <hi>Col.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>Let your ſpeech be ſavoury, ſeaſoned as with ſalt;</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>let no unſavoury or corrupt communication proceed out of your mouthes,</hi> How then doe you finde your owne ſpirits? doe you breath ſavoury and ſweet? and doth your conference yeeld edification? and is it all wel-pleaſing to God, what ever you doe? doth it ſavour wel in the noſtrils of God, and your brethren? If the dutys you perform be ſo, it is ſigne you are living in Gods ſight: But if your ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be prophane, conference unſavoury, and carnal, ſo much as we looſe our ſweetneſſe ſo much we looſe our life, when a Chriſtian carries himſelfe ſerviceably, and amiably, then we live, and in having life we have Chriſt.</p>

            <p>It is with the ſons of men in this kinde (that I may ſo ſpeake) as it was with the Souldiers, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. <hi>they were all dead corps:</hi> truly, that is the caſe of us all by nature; every ſoule of us, as long as we live in the world without Chriſt, ſo many men, ſo many dead corps, ſo many unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury carcaſſes: And indeede all that worke of life, which you have heard opened, it is no ſpiritual motion, no feeding upon Chriſt, no growing in grace, no expelling of noyſome luſts, no care nor indeavour to beget others to an eſtate of grace, in any men that are dead, no motion at all to any ſpiritual good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. al our works, the beſt works we doe in an eſtate of nature, they are all of them but <hi>dead workes;</hi> And ſo are we to any ſpiritual motion. As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tels you, we <hi>none</hi> of us <hi>doe good,</hi> and which is worſe, wee <hi>can doe</hi> no good; yea, and ſtil, which is worſe, wee
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:117852:85"/>would doe no good if we could; this is the eſtate of us all by nature; <hi>The Lord looked downe from heaven, to ſee if any of them did good, but they are altogether become unprofitable, not one, doth good, no not one,</hi> Rom. 3.12.</p>
            <p>And he ſpeakes of all men in an eſtate of nature without Chriſt, not one doth any good, no not one; <hi>All the thoughts and imaginations</hi> of ſuch mens hearts <hi>are evill, and only evill, and that continually,</hi> Gen. 6.1. and Chriſt ſaith as much of their words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.33, 34.

Wherein he ſhewes you, that as we do no good, ſo we can doe no good, not a good thought, nor a good word, nor a good worke comes from ſuch a man all his dayes; and all our ſpeeches are rotten and unſavoury, not any ſpirituall life in most ſeeming beſt duties; we are not able to ſpeake unto any good purpoſe, let if be truly moulded an it is a precious fruit of righteouſneſſe, but if ſpoke as comes from nature, be it never ſo well ſpoken, it is corrupt, either full of pride or ſelfe-conceit, or to pleaſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or the like; nor doe we regulate our words by the <hi>language of Canaan,</hi> nor open our mouthes from a ſpirit of ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.

If God ſhould at any time aſſiſt us, and ſupply us with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then ordinary, yet we will not be made clean, that we might doe well:<note place="margin">Jer. 13. laſt opened.</note> 
               <hi>O Ieruſalem, wilt thou not be made cleane, when will it once be?</hi> Jer. 13. laſt. As if it were a thing never to be looked for, God might waite upon a man from one end of the yeare to another, and ſometimes be asking
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:117852:85"/>of him, Wilt thou be made clean? and he may aske again, Man, wilt thou be made whole? but if he but ſay, Wilt thou be made cleane, we have many devices to put off God, and we can never finde that day, wherein we will ſay, This day we will heare Gods voyce, and be made cleane; from this day forward I reſolve never to think my own thoughts more, nor to doe my owne will more, but now will give up my ſelfe to ſeeke for life and ſalvation in Chriſt; that day is yet never pitched upon till we have found Chriſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince we were borne untill now: but now it may be we are convinced, that it is good to become a Chriſtian, and we wiſh well to ſuch as are Chriſtians; but when it comes to the matter, we are but <hi>almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> as was <hi>Agrippa;</hi> or if we be ſatisfied, that we muſt become Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, then truly it muſt not be to day, but to morrow; and when we thinke to set God a day when indeed it ſhall be, as ſometimes at our <hi>Marriage,</hi> or when we come out of our <hi>Apprentiſhips,</hi> or when we fall <hi>ſick,</hi> when left alone upon the Death-bed, and if God ſay, <hi>Yet, when will it once be?</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet ſet him a day, only we will ſay, We will conſider of it, and we would be loath to disappoint God; as Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will ſay to their Debtors, We would be loath to ſet you a day, becauſe we know not whether we ſhall hold or no, and therefore ſpare us in that, but we will pay you as ſoone as we can; but <hi>when will it once be?</hi> Truly we are not yet perſwaded, there is yet ſomething or other to be done; and therefore you ſhall finde this to be true, that we are ſo farre from ſpirituall life in Chriſt, that none of us doe any good; there is nothing you doe whereof you may ſay, This have I done becauſe God hath ſet me a worke, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods Command, or that God may be ſanctified thereby, never yet could we ſay ſo; and as we have not done any good, ſo neither are we able or capable of good. And in truth this is a further want of ſpirituall action, that if God ſhould make us able to doe it, yet we would not be willing to doe it, but if he put us to the queſtion, <hi>When ſhall it once be?</hi> read that Chapter and the next, and ſee if ever they ſet God a time, they will by no meanes ſet God a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:117852:86"/>time, leaſt they over-much ingage themſelves; indeed, ſometimes it may be you ſhall ſee ſuch men lying under ſome heavie hand of God, and neare to death, reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on time. See our unwillingneſſe to come off to God when we are in health, we thinke in ſickneſſe to be made cleane, but in ſickneſſe, what will we ſay then, ſome of you can tell what men are then wont to ſay; What doe we then ſay? Oh, if God would but reſtore me to health, you ſhould ſee I would become a new man; why when he was in health he ſaid, If ſickneſſe or danger came, that ſhould be the time wherein he would be made cleane, but when ſickneſſe comes, then we put God off till health againe. As if a Debtor ſhould put off his Creditor from Summer to Winter, and from thence to Summer againe, the anſwer will never be given; why now it ſhall be this day ſay you in ſickneſſe, it ſhall be when God ſhall bring me to health; but why not <hi>to day?</hi> you put off God from health to ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and from ſickneſſe to health againe, and when they doe not ſo, and come and tell them of it, they will ſay, Why it is true, God forgive them, they thought to have done ſuch a thing, and they hoped to have done it; <hi>But when ſhall it once be?</hi> Why not to day before to morrow? what if you dye of this ſickneſſe, will you goe to Hell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately? will you take no courſe for turning the wrath of God from you; Are not you now ſick, why doe you deferre it any longer? and though he be not able to turne himſelfe in his bed, yet he may turne to God. It is a vaine thing to put off God to health, for in our ſickneſſe God will ſooner viſit us, and doth expect that <hi>in the day of our affliction we ſhould ſeeke him diligently and early,</hi> Hoſ 5. laſt. <hi>When will it once be?</hi> So that take notice of this deſperate deadneſſe of a mans heart out of Chriſt, he is dead in ſinne, ſo as that he neither doth any good, nor is able to doe any good, nor is willing to doe any good.</p>
            <p>And as there is no ſpirituall motion in him, no act of grace, ſo it is another act of ſpirituall life, for a man to feed upon Chriſt; but doe you thinke a dead man is able to feed upon Chriſt? you know what God ſaid of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous

The good things of this life are no more ſuitable to a mans ſoule, then aſhes be to a mans body, and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo compares the eſtate of all the ſonnes of Nature, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Who knowes the ſpirit of a man that goes upward, and the ſpirit of the beaſt that goes downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the earth?</hi> his meaning is this; he complaining of the vanity that lyes upon the ſonnes of nature, he ſpeakes not in the perſon of an Epicure (as ſome conceive) but his meaning is, <hi>Who knowes;</hi> which of all the ſonnes of men conſiders, or takes it to heart, that his ſoule goes up to any better place then the ſoule of a beaſt, which of all the ſons of Nature feeds his ſoule upon better food, then the ſoule of a beaſt is fed upon? Doe they not all feed, as if they all went to one place? and therefore upon the duſt of the earth they feed; turne me out the man that is in an eſtate of nature, conſiders that his ſoule is to live for ever, and therefore takes care to feed his ſoule to immortality; this is the wofull diſtemper of all the ſonnes of nature, that we

A <hi>lying vanity:</hi> is not my heart deceived with this and that? he is not able to aske his heart ſuch a queſtion, am I ſuch a foole, to forget all good to my ſoule, thus long? it would deliver his ſoul, if hee did but conſider <hi>that there was a lye</hi> in the other way, and he flatters himſelfe in his good eſtate before God, and conſiders not the truth of the thing; he thinkes hee is as faire a dealing man as any of them all, but <hi>his heart deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and deſperately wicked,</hi> and ſo cannot ſee the falſehood of his way.</p>
            <p>And for growing, which is a third act of ſpiritual life, a man is dead to any growth, never comes to any growth in grace, but he is apt to grow in evil and ſin, <hi>evill men and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhall wax worſe and worſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13. take you any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man, and he is ever growing worſe and worſe, ever grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the worſe hand; he growes more and more unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and more looſe from God, and eſtranged from the wayes of his grace, and ſettled in the wayes of ſin. And this is that which the Prophet, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complaines of, chap. 9.3. <hi>they proceeded from evill to worſe,</hi> and this is the eſtate of us all without Chriſt, we grow from prodigality to covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and from wantonnes, to voluptuouſnes, and ſo goe on til we come to take <hi>pleaſure</hi> in all <hi>ſinne,</hi> though it be but for a ſeaſon: This is al the growth and progreſſe that ſuch men make.</p>
            <p>And in the fourth place, for cleanſing our ſelves from al ſuperfluous, and noyſome luſts that we doe not, neither can we be freed from them: <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thy heart from thy wickedneſſe, how long ſhall thy vaine thoughts lodge within thee? Jer.</hi> 4.14. Purge out all thoſe ſinful luſts, God knowes the thoughts of the hearts of men are but vaine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and they being vain, God would have us to waſh our hearts, how long ſhal it be that we ſuffer theſe luſts to lodge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us? we never cleanſe our ſelves from theſe: but ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:117852:87"/>cleanſing it is, that if we goe about to purge them out, by the motions of the ſpirit of grace, that he caſts into our hearts; we think its a troubleſome worke, and doth croſſe the tranquility, and peace of our eſtates, we thinke they are noyſome, and therefore, if any good motion be darted into the heart, in the Miniſtery of the Word, or in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Chriſtian friends, we are ſick of it, till we have caſt out all thoſe good motions againe, and what ever good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection God hath been pleaſed to caſt into us, wee are not wel til we be ſhut of it: as was the caſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> he comes ſadly and mourning from <hi>Eliahs</hi> ſharpe reproofe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. two laſt verſes, but he could not be well at eaſe, til he had caſt it all off, with putting <hi>Naboth</hi> to death, and put it off with calling a Councel about going to War, and ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all the ſorrow that was in his heart. Let <hi>Caine</hi> have any good motion come in his heart, and he wil put it off with <hi>building of Cities:</hi> His ſin, and puniſhment is great, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. and would he not now ſeek to God for mercy that his ſoule might live? no he goes out <hi>from the preſence of God,</hi> and from all good company, and good councel, and whither goes he then? <hi>Into the land of Nod,</hi> and there he <hi>builds Cities,</hi> and <hi>calls</hi> them by ſuch and ſuch <hi>names,</hi> and ſo takes off his thoughts from any good motion, and extinguiſhes all the motions of grace: And truly ſo ſtood the caſe with <hi>Foelix, Act.</hi> 24.25. when <hi>he trembled</hi> at <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon, he would not indure to hear him any further, but when he had <hi>convenient leaſure he would hear him again;</hi> but he never ſent for him. And ſo you ſhall ever find this frame in a naturall mans heart, thoſe motions which the ſpirit of God caſts into his heart, that might induce him, and lead him on by the hand to better courſes, we are not wel til we have caſt them all off. Juſt as <hi>Paul</hi> complaines of the <hi>Jewes, Act.</hi> 13.46. <hi>ſince you have put it away from you, loe, we turne to the Gentiles,</hi> we purge, and caſt out the motions of Gods ſpirit, and cannot indure that any Ordinance ſhould bring us nearer to Chriſt; Act. 7.51. <hi>Yee have always reſiſted the holy ghoſt,</hi> expelled the bleſſed of God that if the holy ghoſt but dart any good councel into their hearts, they cannot indure to hear it, nor entertain any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:117852:88"/>of it, but <hi>grieve</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> the holy Spirit of God, and they are not well till they <hi>quench it,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.19. Eſa. 5.3. we are <hi>alive</hi> to nothing but to run away from God, alive to ſinne, <hi>alive to doe evill, but to doe well we have no underſtanding, Jer.</hi> 4.22. Apt to purge and cleanſe our ſelves from all good things, but wholly undiſpoſed to doe any thing that is well; this is the true eſtate of us all: Look at us as we are by nature, all of us without Chriſt cannot put forth one act of ſpirituall life, not one good motion to be found in ſuch a condition.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place for begetting any unto grace, we rather doe the quite contrary, we addict our ſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get men to become <hi>the children of Hell,</hi> worſe then our ſelves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15. <hi>two-fold more the children of Hell;</hi> and becauſe that may be more proper to corrupt teachers, <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeakes it of all the ſonnes of nature, and thoſe eſpecially that had lived a while under the meanes, and were not thereby brought on to an eſtate of grace, thoſe whom God had kindled ſome fire in their hearts, and whom he would have brought on to grace, even theſe; <hi>They are all grievouſly revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, walking with ſlanders, they are braſſe and Iron, they are all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters,</hi> Jer. 6.28. He doth not ſay, they are all <hi>corrupted,</hi> but all <hi>corrupters;</hi> that is, ſuch as are not only naught them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they corrupt others alſo, they make others worſe for their ſakes; No man that ſets his face to God-ward, but if he come among them, he is the worſe for them; every man is kept off the more from goodneſſe by their meanes, they doe not love that men ſhould be too forward, or too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, nor to keep ſuch a puleing, nor ſuch a praying; we are all by nature corrupters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.11. <hi>All fleſh had corrupted their way;</hi> even every man had done it, every one is the worſe for us that hath to doe with us, if we ſee but any good diſpoſition in them to be comming on in the waies of grace, we doe as much as in us lyes to quench, and damp, and ſmother them, and never reſt by our good wills till we make them as ill as our ſelves, and <hi>harden their hearts from Gods feare;</hi> this is the true carriage of all thoſe who are out of Chriſt: <hi>He that hath not the Son, he hath no life;</hi> no motion of ſpirituall life, no growing up in Chriſt, no purging out
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:117852:88"/>of ſinfull uncleanneſſe; and therefore now to apply this, conceive thus much:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It applyes it ſelfe againſt the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> firſt, who maintaine, that men in the ſtate of nature, have free will to lay hold upon Chriſt, and they conceive it is upon very faire termes; but I would only demand of you this queſtion, Whether when they doe lay hold on Chriſt (as they conceive) whether they have him, or they have him not? they, will ſay, They have not Chriſt till they have received him; <hi>for what haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. And till they have received him, how ſhall they lay hold upon him? and if not receive him, they are dead men; and when a man is dead what can he have by any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that is offered him? Offer him never ſo largely, and he can receive no benefit by it; and if that any doe lay hold upon Chriſt, were they not living when they ſo layed hold upon him; ſo that when they doe lay hold upon Chriſt, whether is it an action of life or no? If not, how ſhall they lay hold on Chriſt, and without Chriſt no life. A man in the ſtate of nature neither doth good, nor can he doe any good, nor is he willing to doe good; and therefore well doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>It is God that workes in you both the will and the deed,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. Any thing that we doe that is good, is wholly from the grace of Chriſt, and this is juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It ſerves to teach us all to bemoane our owne eſtates, or the eſtates of any of ours, that we yet ſee in the gall of bitterneſſe, lying in an eſtate of nature; is it thy ſelfe, or thy father, or mother, or thy children or ſervants? whatever he be, be he never ſo good a natured man, if he be yet without Chriſt, there is no life in him; I ſay, looke upon him as thy dead friend; If thou didſt look upon thy father, and mother, or children, and ſee them lye dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, thou wouldeſt mourne bitterly for them; you know what is ſaid, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>As a man mournes for his firſt borne;</hi> if our firſt borne, or any that is neare to us dye, we mourne bitterly for them, and refuſe to be comforted, as was the caſe of <hi>Rachels</hi> mourning for her children, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:117852:89"/>would not be comforted becauſe they were not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.18. they were all dead, and therefore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>a bitter mourning;</hi> it was the wounding and rending of her ſoule. And may not this be the caſe of many a fruitfull mother, many children, and yet all of them dead in Gods ſight, not a ſoule living in the ſight of God? And is it not a farre more bitter death to be dead in ſinne, then to be dead in the body, when it is a living ſoule in Gods ſight? then, <hi>bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord, for even ſo ſaith the Spirit,</hi> that never ſpake words of falſhood, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.13. I ſay therefore, if that our children live to God, and have the life of grace in their hearts, there is no danger of their death; then thy children ſhall come againe to thy hearing, <hi>at the reſurrection of the juſt,</hi> and thou ſhalt imbrace them with comfort, and fill thy ſoule with unſpeakable joy, and fulneſſe of glory; if they dye in the favour and grace of God, they ſhall <hi>riſe to glory,</hi> but if they be ſpiritually dead, no goodneſſe in the world in them, no ſpirituall life at all, no life of righteouſneſſe or holineſſe, which are the <hi>firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> and of glory in this world; then weep for theſe children, and thoſe friends, that husband, or wife, or brother, or ſiſter; weep for every ſoule that is in an eſtate of ſinne and death, they are as ſo many dead Corps; you may ſometimes ſee a whole houſe-full of dead creatures, not one of them living to God, not one of thy acquaintance, not one of all thy brothers and ſiſters; weep and mourne bitterly for them that are thus wounded with ſinne, and bleed deadly, and gaſpe for their laſt breath, and it may be ſhall never finde grace from God in this world, their preſent condition is fearefull; and mourne thou for them in a godly manner, that thou mayeſt be the more earneſt with God in that behalfe; and never leave, till thou haſt got ſome grace from Chriſt for them, and in ſo doing you ſhall finde, that he that gave you children will give them life, and he that gave you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſiſters, and friends, and acquaintance, he will put ſome life into them, and it ſhall doe you good at the heart, as in verſ. 16. of this chapter; <hi>Let him aske, and he ſhall give him life.</hi> The promiſe is marvellous ſweet and ſtrong,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:117852:89"/>you may handle the matter ſo, that as you have inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally given them <hi>naturall life,</hi> you may procure them <hi>ſpirituall life,</hi> they came out of your loynes dead in ſinne, and they will grow in ſinne more and more, more unſavoury, and more unprofitable, and worldly, and proud, and wanton, this is their naturall condition; well, if they be ſo borne, then weep over them, and mourne bitterly for them. You would mourne for a childe if ſtill-borne, much more if you ſee it dying, and giving up the ghoſt, and lying in extreame and bitter paine, how much more for that ſoule that hath no grace, nothing at all in them, in regard of which you can ſay, this is a pledge to me of Jeſus Chriſt in them; you know what a bitter mourning fell out in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.30. <hi>A great cry was heard in Aegypt,</hi> and they all roſe up at <hi>midnight;</hi> What was the matter? Why this was it, <hi>There was not an houſe wherein there was not one dead,</hi> and upon this occaſion they roſe <hi>up at midnight,</hi> and filled their ſtreets with bitter cryes, and what then thinke you would they have done, if in every family there had been but one alive? all dead but himſelfe, neither one nor other, ſometimes old, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times young, all gone ſave only one, to mourne for all the reſt; and this is ſometimes the caſe of many a ſoule, he may riſe every morning, and ſee not a ſoule in his family of which he can ſay, <hi>this is not a dead corps;</hi> if there were but one dead ſoule it might cauſe thee to mourne, and that greatly, juſt occaſion to mourne bitterly, if there be but one in thy houſe that comes not on to the wayes of grace and ſalvation; this is it that God calls us to, ſadly to conſider of it, bitterly to bemoane it, and to pray heartily for ſuch poore ſoules to God, that he would be pleaſed to ſhew mercy to them all, that you might have ſome living com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſome that might be wrapt up in life and peace, and bring them within the covenant of grace, and life, and ſalvation; if you have but the bowels of friends, if but the bowels of Chriſtian men, take to heart your owne, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miſerable condition, if they be dead, and without Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. To teach us all, that if ſo be that we, or any of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:117852:90"/>ours be yet without Chriſt,<note place="margin">Procure Chriſt for our ſelves, and others.</note> let it exhort us not to give reſt to our eyes, nor ſlumber to our eye-lids, till we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Chriſt for our ſelves, and ours, that we may procure life for our ſelves, and others. What is it for a man to have a good wife, or a good husband, or beautifull children? What if he had rich kindred and acquaintance? What if he had all the world, and have not Chriſt, he hath no life; had we all the friends we have, and as much comfort as we could wiſh, and want Chriſt, it were poore empty comfort, and therefore labour above all things to get Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For motives hereunto:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Motives to get Chriſt.</note>Firſt, it is taken from the ſweetneſſe of life, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life,</hi> Job 2.4. and what is a life without grace? What is the naturall life without a ſpirituall? This naturall life is worth the giving and parting with for a ſpirituall; <hi>What ſhall a man give in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his ſoule?</hi> Matth. 16.26. You know what Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the ſame reaſon holds true in every man that wants life in Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.24. <hi>It had been good for that man he had never been borne;</hi> ſo may we ſay of all our ſoules, it had been good for us we had never been borne, if we dye without grace, we ſhall then have our portion with hypocrites, and unbeleevers, and therefore let ſpirituall life be more ſweet to you then naturall.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, conſider if you have Chriſt, <hi>you have life,</hi> and that <hi>in abundance,</hi> and you have all the bleſſings of God, of all lives it is the moſt comfortable, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. If you have Chriſt, you have all the promiſes, <hi>For in him they are, yea, and in him Amen;</hi> and they ſhall all be ratified and confirmed, and eſtabliſht to you, and all the bleſſings of God are thine, Eſa. 1.3. <hi>He hath blest you with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> all bleſſings both ſpirituall and temporall too, all the bleſſings of this and another life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. laſt. <hi>All is yours;</hi> all the <hi>ordinances</hi> of God is yours, and all the <hi>world</hi> is yours; not a creature in the world but is at your ſervice: yea your enemies is for your good and ſervice. <hi>Eſau</hi> was <hi>Jacobs</hi> Servant even then when he cals him Lord; and therefore make account of this, if you have
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:117852:90"/>Chriſt, make account of this, you have all things; and therefore read the Promiſes, and gather them up, and lay them up as a treaſure, <hi>all things are yours;</hi> all the bleſſings you read or heare of, they are all ſome way or other for your benefit, and I want but faith to ſee and diſcerne it, and an heart to acknowledge it, if I doe feele it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you want righteouſneſſe, or peace, or goods, or friends, or any bleſſing in this world, or for another, if you have Chriſt you have all that his is; <hi>He that hath given us his owne Son, will not he with him give us all things alſo?</hi> Rom. 8.32. So that there is a double motive, that every ſoule might be ſtirred up to looke after Chriſt; and this is the ſeaſon, ſtay not till to morrow, and though the morrow be a Sabbath, a bleſſed day, yet you know not <hi>what this day may bring forth;</hi> ſome of us may fall ſick, or dye this night, or not fit to profit by to morrowes meanes, as it is this day, and therefore while the day of grace laſts, take hold of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But what ſhall I doe to get him? how may I come to have him? you ſaid, we cannot reach Chriſt by nature, and though we could we will not; Are not exhortations then in vaine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, they are not in vaine, for though in nature we are neither willing, nor able to looke after Chriſt, but looke at him as a vaine refuſe commodity; we would have lands, and goods, but no Chriſt, and therefore what muſt we doe?</p>
            <p n="1">1 Though we be of that naturall ſinfull diſtemper, that we would have all things but Chriſt, and let him goe, yet while we are thus ſpeaking to you, God many times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys ſuch a ſpirit of grace into us, as gives us power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt; what power had the <hi>Cripple</hi> to ſtand, much leſſe to walke, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.6, 7. he had no power to walke; and it had been a vaine ſpeech to him if there had not been a power in it to convey ſtrength into him by his breath, and the Lord Jeſus working in it, which did convey ſuch ſtrength into him, as that preſently he did walke. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo is it with the Servants of God, thoſe that ſhal be ſaved, we ſpeake not in vaine to them, the word that we ſpeake
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:117852:91"/>conveyes ſpirit and life into them, then they begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive life in him, and are glad, that they may finde Chriſt, and for other men, it leaves them without excuſe, if they do not uſe the meanes, God appoints them to uſe.</p>
            <p>And the means God preſcribes to us are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Means of having Chriſt.</note>Firſt, as ever thou wouldeſt have Chriſt, labour wiſely to ponder upon and conſider, how dead thou art without Chriſt, for thou ſhalt never find life by Chriſt, unleſſe thou find thy ſelfe loſt without him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.10. <hi>Christ came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> If thou ſeeſt thy ſelf loſt, Chriſt will ſeek thee up; be fully ſatisfied of this in thy judgement and mind, that unleſſe thou haſt Chriſt, thou haſt no life, and therefore mourn and pray, <hi>The whole need not the Phyſitian but them that are ſicke, Matth.</hi> 9.12, 13. See thy ſelfe a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and a periſhing creature unleſſe Chriſt ſeeke thee up.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take this meanes, as ever you deſire to have life in Chriſt, if thou knoweſt any ſin by thy ſelfe, thou art much to blame in thy ſelfe, if thou doſt not by any meanes waſh thy hands of it,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> cleanſe thy ſelfe from it. There are many ſins which a man lives in, which he might avoid by very common gifts, which would he renounce, God would not be wantng to lead him on to further grace, John 3.18, 19. <hi>This is condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love darkeneſſe rather then light.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.17, 18. <hi>touch no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing,</hi> meddle not with vain company: and have nothing to doe with the <hi>unfruitfull workes of darkeneſſe,</hi> and then I wil <hi>be a father to you, and you ſhall be my Sons and Daughters;</hi> if wee would but abhor, that which we know to be nought, God promiſeth to receive us. And it is the ſame that you read, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. to ſhew you that if men do begin <hi>to learn</hi> to be better, if they <hi>ceaſe to doe evill, and learn to do well,</hi> if they acknowledge their ſins, in the ſight of God, God wil ſo <hi>ſprinkle the blood of Chriſt</hi> upon them, as that their great ſins ſhal be forgiven them; and upon the ſame termes men might feed upon the paſchal Lamb, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12.15. they muſt <hi>put all leaven out of their houſes, purge out therefore the old leaven, and ye ſhall become a new lumpe,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. purge out the old,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:117852:91"/>and ye ſhall be new creatures in Chriſt, purge out the <hi>leaven of maliciouſneſſe and wickedneſſe,</hi> and whatever is ſinfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, away with it, touch no uncleane thing; and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his wickedneſſe, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous his thoughts,</hi> and then, <hi>I am a God ready to pardon, I will forgive all your iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Seeke the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is nigh,</hi> Eſa. 55.7, 8. <hi>Seeke him and your ſoule ſhall live; God is abundantly ready to pardon, &amp;c.</hi> How ſhall I ſeeke him? no man hath a deſire to ſeeke, but that which he hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to finde; and therefore <hi>hunger,</hi> and <hi>thirſt</hi> after him, as it is in the firſt verſe of that Chapter; deſire nothing ſo much as thy part in Chriſt, and beſides, endeavour to finde him in the meanes, verſ. 3. <hi>Heare, and your ſoules ſhall live;</hi> hearken diligently to the Word of God. It is a notable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at the poſts of my gates, for he that findeth me, findeth life.</hi> Conſider, there is no man that heares Chriſt but hee findes him; and if he finde him, he ſhall have life by him. And therefore how much cauſe have men to ſtraighten themſelves a little in their worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to heare daily? <hi>for who ſo findeth me findeth life,</hi> and he that hears me findes me: Heare therefore diligently, <hi>and your ſoules ſhall live:</hi> Shake off all drowſineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit, and be deſirous to receive Chriſt in his Word that is ſpoken to you, and ſo ſeeke him in calling upon him, ver. 7, 8. <hi>Call upon him while he is nigh;</hi> And when <hi>is he nigh?</hi> Every day, if you ſtay longer then the preſent day, you have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity offered you; call upon God now, and wraſtle with him in your prayers, that that which you have heard may be life, and the length of your dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. To teach every ſoule that hath already found Chriſt, and yet complaines thou haſt a dead heart, and a dull minde; an heavie ſpirit, heavie affections, nothing lively cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell thy corruptions, cannot beget others to God, and art not active in ſpirituall workes; then if thou finde a want or decay of life, then ſeeke for Chriſt againe, labour for more Chriſt, and thou ſhalt have more life; reſt not in having a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:117852:92"/>good meaſure of grace, for thou wilt finde a world of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weakneſſe, in beginnings of grace; but as thou wouldeſt have any further meaſures of life, ſo looke for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaſures of Chriſt, for Chriſt diſpenſeth himſelfe to us in meaſure by little and little, and uſe the ſame meanes to increaſe him, as thou didſt to get him at the firſt; ſee thy ſelfe loſt without him, and thirſt after him, and heare dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and call earneſtly upon him for more ſtrength, uſe Chriſt and have Chriſt, uſe grace and have grace; grow up in the uſe of him, and thou ſhalt grow up in the poſſeſſion of him; and therefore as you have <hi>received Chriſt ſo walke in him,</hi> Col. 2.7, 8. As if that were the way to get more roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Chriſt; labour <hi>to live by faith,</hi> and walke to the glory of Chriſt, and by the rules of Chriſt, and by that meanes you will be more built up, rooted, and eſtabliſhed in him.</p>

They that hate me love death; if you ſeek not Chriſt, you ſeeke death, and miſchiefe, and deſtruction to your owne ſoules and yours, <hi>verſ. laſt;</hi> and therefore as you deſire to finde Chriſt ſeeke him, and having found him, rejoyce in him, that God hath given you to finde him, and then walke as thoſe that deſire for ever to have him, as not to change your portion by any meanes. If you have Chriſt you have enough, and if you ſit looſe to Chriſt for the enjoyment of earthly bleſſings, what will they advantage you; but chiefly labour to get Chriſt, and then, <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are now come to enter upon the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the concluſion of this whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, wherein the Apoſtle rehearſeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſcope of the whole fore-paſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle; the perſons and ſubjects to whom he writes, and the end and ſcope of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you;</hi> To whom? <hi>To you that beleeve on the name of the Sonne of God.</hi> And he intends a double end:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>you may know that you have eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That you may beleeve on the Name of the Sonne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to encourage to this latter end that <hi>John</hi> aimes at; beleeving on the name of the Sonne of God, he propounds three motives, in the 15, 16, 17. verſes; amongſt which the laſt of them is a promiſe of prevailing with God for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and a prevention of falling into the great ſinne, and ſo propoundeth certaine incouragements to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now at this time, we ſhall treat of the firſt part of this concluſion, which is an expreſſion that <hi>John</hi> here makes, or a deſcription of the perſons here ſpoken to; to them <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on the name of the Son of God;</hi> from the perſons to whom
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:117852:93"/>
               <hi>John</hi> dedicates this Epiſtle, to them that beleeve on the name of the Son of God; obſerve,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>This Epiſtle of</hi> John <hi>was written, or directed to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers on the name of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is evident in the text, which may be gathered from the beginning of the Epiſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Chapter 1.4. he writes to ſuch, who by reading this Epiſtle might attaine to <hi>fulneſſe of joy,</hi> and thoſe are only beleevers, who are capable of that mercy and bleſſing; you may gather the ſame from the three ſorts of Chriſtians, to whom he writes in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, verſ. 12. in chap. 2. <hi>I write unto you little children, becauſe your ſins are forgiven you;</hi> and theſe little children are divided into three ſorts, verſ. 13. <hi>Fathers, young men, and babes,</hi> ſo that looke at all that <hi>Iohn</hi> writes to, they are ſuch as make a faithfull acknowledgement of God the Father, as chap. 4. verſ. 4. And looke at his ſecond Epiſtle, and that is to the <hi>Elect Lady;</hi> and looke at his third Epiſtle, and that is firſt to the beloved <hi>Gaius;</hi> and he ſhewes you what a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſtian he was, he wiſhes no further proſperity to his <hi>body</hi> and outward eſtate, then his <hi>ſoule</hi> had attained unto, his <hi>ſoule</hi> was in great proſperity, only his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>eſtate</hi> was weake, for he was <hi>the Hoſt of the whole Church of God,</hi> ſo that looke at all <hi>Iohns</hi> writings, and they are all written to them that <hi>beleeve on the name of the Son of God.</hi> And in very deed looke at all the Epiſtles of all the reſt of the Apoſtles, and they are all written to <hi>Beleevers;</hi> if you ſumme them all up from firſt to laſt, looke at the Protheſis of every Epiſtle; in the firſt, ſecond, and third verſes of every Epiſtle, and they are written ſometimes to <hi>Saints by calling,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brethren,</hi> ſometimes to the <hi>Churches of Chriſt, naturall Sons, partakers of the common ſalvation;</hi> in a word, only to thoſe that were <hi>faithfull beleevers in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> And when our bleſſed Saviour himſelfe writes, he writes to the <hi>ſeven Churches of Aſia,</hi> all of them ſuch as ſometime had been eminent, and glorious, and gracious, and amongſt the weakeſt he had a <hi>few names, even in</hi> Sardis, <hi>that had not defiled their garments,</hi> chap. 4.3. Now when a man ſhall conſider, that all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doe dedicate all their writings to beleevers and Saints,

            <p>And thoſe benefits are many and divers.</p>
            <p>As firſt, Teaching,<note place="margin">Teaching</note> that is one benefit the Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by theſe Epiſtles, 2 Theſ. 2.15. <hi>brethren ſtand faſt, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whither by Word, or by our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</hi> This was one end of the Apoſtles writing their Epiſtles, to the intent they might teach the Church of God ſundry things which elſe they had not known.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>2 Another benefit the Churches received from theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was Admonition, and putting them in remembrance of the things they had heard, things which they did know before, and which happily they had forgotten, 2 Pet. 1.12, 13. <hi>I thought it neceſſary to put you in remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Practiſe.</note>3 And in verſe 13. there is a third benefit of them, To ſtir them up to do ſuch things, which though they wel knew ſhould be done, yet they were dul, and ſlow of heart, and ſtood in need to be ſtirred up to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Another end of their writings was this,<note place="margin">Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they might Humble and bring low the ſpirits of thoſe that wer puffed up, &amp; had not repented of the ſin which they had committed, 2 Cor. 7.8. <hi>I was ſorry at the firſt that I made you ſorry,</hi> but now I am not ſorry, for it was a godly ſorrow; ſo that it ſeemes the writings of the Apoſtles did much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the faithfull people of God, and wrought in them ſuch godly ſorrow, that it was a comfort to the Apoſtle, that he had ſometimes <hi>grieved them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the faith.</note>5 Another end was, that ſo by this meanes they might be ſtrengthened in the faith, according to what you read in the words of the Text, to them that did beleeve, he wrote that they might beleeve, meaning that they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and eſtabliſhed in beleeving.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <note place="margin">Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</note>6 Alſo, to the intent that they might fil the hearts of Gods

So that ſee how much help the Church of God hath had by theſe writings, ſo that they have found much comfort in them. And theſe writings have been the foundation of the faith of Gods people, from that time to the worlds end, they have ever yeelded matter to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to preach and expound to the people, that by preaching they might bring on men to ſalvation, ſo that the holy ghoſt would not have Miniſters nor any other to be <hi>wiſe above what is written,</hi> 2 Tim. 4 16, 17. That when theſe are put into the hand of a faithful Scribe, <hi>taught unto the Kingdome of God,</hi> he may be able to uſe this two-edged ſword <hi>of the ſpirit,</hi> to all thoſe ends by which we come to be made perfect <hi>unto ſalvation,</hi> and this is the ſcope of the ſpirit of God in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 1. Why they are written to ſuch as beleeve, As they ſerve for thoſe benefits, ſo alſo for thoſe ends. It is taken from the little uſe which unbeleevers will make of theſe writings till they come on to beleeving, ſo little, that were it not for ſome beleevers among them, whom God had reſpect unto, none of all the Apoſtles would have vouchſafed to have written any one Epiſtle to any unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of any Town or Aſſembly, none of them all writes to any, but to ſuch as <hi>beleeve on the name of the ſon of God:</hi> had there been any benefit likely to be expected from unbeleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations, ſome or other would have written to them: but from firſt to laſt, look over them all, and obſerve them, whether they be written to particular perſons, or to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations, or to Churches or Nations, they are all written to ſuch as beleeve <hi>on the name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> For it is with the Apoſtles writings, as the Apoſtle ſometimes ſpeakes of propheſie or miracles, <hi>miracles are for them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not, but propheſie for them that beleeve,</hi> he doth not deny but propheſie is for them that beleeve not, but he ſpeaks by way of oppoſition to miracles; miracles are rather for them that beleeve not; and he would have beleevers know, it is rather for them to attend unto propheſie, then unto miracles, ſo that this is the poynt: Obſerve it, as a juſt ground of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:117852:94"/>Apoſtles dealing in theſe writings, Becauſe of the little uſe that unbeleevers will make of them.</p>
            <p>Take you men that beleeve not, and let them read the Word of God over again and againe, and yet they receive little inſtruction from what they read, little admonition, little ſtirred up to any goodneſſe: And you ſhal not at all find any bleſſing, no ſaving gift of God, can be wrought in the heart without faith, and becauſe <hi>faith comes</hi> not by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but by <hi>hearing,</hi> therefore the Apoſtle writes not to them that beleeve not, but to ſuch as are beleevers. If ever God had intended that the reading of theſe writings had been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the begetting of faith, ſurely he would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them with mighty works, as he bleſſed the preaching of the Goſpel, in the primitive times, with miraculous workes; but you ſhal not read in any Scripture, that ever God ſo farre bleſſed the Word read to any man, or that he ever wrought a miracle to confirme the Word read, where the word hath been taught: God magnified it much in the firſt publiſhers of it, til the whole world was convicted. And had God been pleaſed at any time to thinke that theſe writings ſhould be effectual to convert men to grace, ſurely, it had been a notable meanes for the Apoſtles to have ſent ſundry Epiſtles to many Churches, to whom they ſhould never perſonally come: But this was their care, to goe all over the world, to preach here and there, all the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, round about the world, as much as in them lay, which they needed not to have don, in caſe the ſending of an Epiſtle would have ſerved the turne. Notable is that ſpeech, and famous in this kind, Rom. 10.14, to 17. <hi>Faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi> So that in very truth, becauſe the Apoſtles did not ſee, of what uſe their writings might bee to any unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſe <hi>all the work that reading could reach unto, could not reach to beget and worke ſaving faith, which is the principall ſcope of preaching;</hi> therefore they did never addreſſe themſelves to write any of their Epiſtles, to any unbeleever, but onely to ſuch as beleeve on the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>You ſay, But ſometimes God hath been pleaſed to bleſſe in old time the reading of the Word to the converſion of ſoules; and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:117852:95"/>therefore why may we not expect the like bleſſing upon the reading of the Goſpell in theſe dayes, as well as the Law in former times? in</hi> Deut. 31.11, 12, 13. <hi>(A place much ſtood upon in this caſe) it was commanded there that the people</hi> ſhould come up to Jeruſalem, <hi>and there the</hi> Law should be read before them, verſ. 11. that they may heare, and learne, and feare, verſe 12. and their children that knew not the Lord, may learne to feare the Lord their God: <hi>Where you ſee, God bleſſed the reading of the Law, not only for the benefit of them that knew it before, but their children alſo, that knew not any thing, may learn to feare the Lord: And if God did ſo bleſſe the reading of the Law in former times, as a notable inſtrument to bring on them to beleeve that never knew any thing of Gods word before? Surely one would expect that the Goſpel, which of the two, is rather</hi> the miniſtration of the ſpirit <hi>then of the letter, or then the Law, that it ſhould be as mighty this way for the begetting of Gods fear in men, as ever the Law was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſhal not read, that this was the benefit or bleſſing that God did accompany the Law withal, in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reading of the ſame; But this was a ſolemn reading, once in ſeven yeares, and no oftener, or once in fifty years. It was a reading at the feaſt of Tabernacles, in the yeare of ſolemnity, as verſe 10, 11, to 13. In a time of ſolemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, that was once every ſeven yeares; And what was the reaſon that then it ſhould have ſuch a more then ordinary bleſſing? Why, this year of Releaſe, was the acceptable year of the Lord, which typed out to them, the year of releaſe by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For he was crucified in one of theſe ſeventh years.<note place="margin">Note this.</note> In the year of Jubilee; And to make it a type and ſhadow of what benefit we ſhould have by reading the Word, when we ſhould be releaſed from our ſinnes by faith in his blood.</p>
            <p>In that ſolemne reading, God gave a more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bleſſing to little children thoſe poore ignorant things that uſually come to the Congregation, and heare much, but learn little, yet even they in the year of Releaſe, when the time comes that God would ſhadow out to them their releaſe by Chriſt; even then little children, that know not any thing, ſhal get ſome knowledge, and fear of God, by hearing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:117852:95"/>of thoſe words then read, ſo that it was ſuch a reading as was upon ſuch a ſolemne year of releaſe as typed out Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; to ſhew you, that men that are come to a yeare of releaſe from all their ſins by Chriſt, they ſhall heare and know, and though they know nothing before, now they ſhall never read but with ſome profit, and ſome growth in Gods feare.</p>
            <p>And another anſwer may be this; That when he there ſpeakes of reading, he ſpeakes not of bare reading, reading is ſome times put for all that expounding and applying, that did ordinarily accompany their reading at ſuch a time, for it was at the ſame feaſt that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſpeakes, chap. 8. laſt. It is ſaid, chap 8.4. to 8. there was a Pulpit of Wood; and in verſ. 8. it is ſaid, <hi>They did read diſtinctly in the Law, and caused the people to underſtand the meaning of it;</hi> ſo that it was not a meere outward and bare reading of the letter, but an opening of the ſence, and ſuch a kinde of applying it to the hearts of the people, that the people went away much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, becauſe they underſtood the Law that was read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and many of them could not but joy and rejoyce in it, as you ſee from verſ. 8. to the end of the 12th. and when they had ſo done the people went away rejoycing, and he ſaid to them, <hi>Goe your way home, eate the fat, and drinke the ſweet, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 10. So that this you ſhall finde to be true, that God hath either never ſo farre forth bleſſed the reading of the Word, as to bring on unbeleevers to Chriſt, either never, or if he have, it is at ſome ſolemne extraordinary feaſt, once in ſeven, or once in fifty yeares, which was their great Jubilee, to make knowne to his Church what in after times it ſhould be, when they knew Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe,</hi> It may ſerve firſt, to let us ſee a reaſon why ſo many Writings of godly men to ſo good purpoſe, and by ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and ſo effectually by many, have ſo little prevailed againſt the Papiſts, and Hereticks in any kinde, a man would wonder to read ſo many Writings of ſo many holy men, and to ſee ſo few of the Church of God brought on to God by this meanes; Why what's the reaſon? ſurely it is no wonder, the Apoſtles themſelves, though they ſhould
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:117852:96"/>never proſper in writing to men that beleeved not, but to ſuch as beleeved, that they might have joy in beleeving, they knew reading would not prevaile; It is true, it may be ſome meanes of conviction, and leaving men without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; and their Writings have not been in vaine, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them in the truth that beleeved it before, and for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the judgements of them that are ſtudious in the truth, to ſeeke out the truth of Gods will; but for men that are unbeleevers, and ſetled in the dreggs thereof, never any Writer in <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> did any good, ſome have come over that have pretended, that this and that mans learned Writings hath been of much help to them, but thoſe who have profeſſed ſuch conviction, have been but meer counterfeits, and deluders of the State, and did it only to provide for their honour and credit here in this Country; and as little hath been done by the Writings of godly men, againſt the adverſaries in this kinde; <hi>So in very deed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The bane of congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that have no meanes of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
               <hi>if you ſhall looke at all the good that hath been done by reading in poore Congregations, that have had no meanes of preaching, the people are as ignorant as thoſe that never heard of the name of Chriſt, as empty of faith, and of the knowledge of Chriſt, and of every grace of his, as thoſe that never heard of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you ſay, <hi>This is marvellous uncharitable, to ſay, that they who have but reading fall ſhort of faith in Chriſt, and of the fruits of faith that accompany ſalvation?</hi>

A long time they had been without God, why had they not the Word of God read in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues? Doe you thinke <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Prieſts did not read the Law? Was there no mention of the Law of God among them? Had they not ſo much forme of godlineſſe, as to read the writings of the Law? Yes ſure, their Civill Law, in which their civill Government ſtood, and by which they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:117852:96"/>executed Juſtice, was the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and did they not then underſtand the letter of the Law? doubtleſſe theſe bookes being their Law, they were knowne among the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the people; and what did the Prieſts, if they did not read the bookes of the Law, were they only to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Calves? I doubt not the people did not doe it, neither was it uſuall to offer any of their Oblations in their Synagogues, but at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> only, and therefore they were not wanting to heare the Prophets read, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that reading, it is ſaid <hi>Iſrael, hath a long time been without God,</hi> they had a Prieſt to read, but not a Prieſt to teach, and ſo were without God, and without the Law; that is, the ſentence God gives of the people at that time, and thinke not that God was uncharitable in ſo ſpeaking of them, for God expreſſeth his love in ſhewing the people their dangerous eſtate, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.14, 15.</p>
            <p>

            <p>

To teach all that beleeve on the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, diligently to be converſant in the Writings of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of the Apoſtles; Shall the Holy Ghoſt have a Pen to write unto us, and ſhall not we have a hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe Writings, and by faith to behold and beleeve them? Shall he take care to write us Letters from Heaven, from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, indicted by the bleſſed Spirit, and written by the hands of faithfull Scribes, who were carried to all truth? and ſhall they write them to us, to continue to the end of the world, and ſhall not we attend to them? <hi>Theſe be written to every ſoule that beleeves in Chriſt;</hi> for if written to them that beleeve in Chriſt, then every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever may ſay, Theſe writings are written to me, to thee and to me, and therefore let us carefully read, and attend to them. And therefore doe not neglect a Letter written by ſuch precious Scribes, and from the hand of a gracious God, that directed them to us; but if written to us, and for our inſtruction and learning, let us heare, and read, and obey, and looke at them as the chiefeſt bleſſings, and ornaments of God vouchſafed to us. Among all the meanes of grace, put up theſe writings as the Oracles of God, for our inſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatever was written aforetime was written for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and edification,</hi> as well as for them that lived in ancient times; how much are the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to blame, that lock up theſe Epiſtles from the common people in ſtrange
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:117852:97"/>Languages? and if they underſtand not Latine they muſt not read, unleſſe with licenſe, or in a ſtrange Tongue; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie will the curſe of God fall upon them, they may as well read a Fable to them as the Scripture; yea many times the Prieſts themſelves underſtood not the Latine that they read, it was given to them as a claſped booke, they were not able to expound it, but ſay, that ignorance in the people is the Mother of Devotion, and therefore both fall into the ditch together.</p>

And beſides, they are of this uſe, they are of ſingular benefit to diſcover to people what ſinne is, and open to men what morall and common vertues be, and ſo are a meanes to preſerve people in a forme of godlineſſe: whereby they know that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are to be obeyed, Miniſters reverenced, Parents ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, Murder not to be committed, the Sabbath not to be prophained, God only to be worſhipped; the body of

            <p> 
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. If God having thus written, and given us theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, then firſt, it will be a juſt refutation of that Popiſh Doctrine, that thinke it impoſſible for a man to know that he is in an eſtate of grace. If <hi>John</hi> did write theſe Epiſtles for this end, <hi>that we might know we have eternall life,</hi> then ſure we may know it, elſe <hi>Iohn</hi> failes of his end; and for <hi>Iohn</hi> to be diſappointed were leſſe matter, but the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, for <hi>Iohn</hi> being the Pen-man of the Holy Ghoſt, the holy end he aymes at not being attainable, is to put a defiance upon the Almighty, and therefore the knowledge that <hi>we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life</hi> may be attained; and whereas they tell us, we may have a conjecturall knowledge, but no certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but to ſay we have a knowledge, and yet but conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturall, is as much as to eate up a mans words he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid; for a conjecturall knowledge is no knowledge at all.<note place="margin">Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what</note> 
               <hi>Knowledge is the judgement or diſcerning a man hath of a certaine thing.</hi> If a man aske you, whether he know if ſuch a man have poſſeſſion of ſuch a place, and he ſay firſt, yes, and afterwards ſaith, he conjectures ſo; his knowledge is no knowledge, it is a falſe intelligence. If you aske a man, if he knowes whether ſuch a man have ſuch a portion of ſuch a value, and he ſay, he hath, he conjectures ſo, it is no knowledge; but if he know it, then he ſpeakes of a certainty. And therefore if the holy Ghoſt ſay, <hi>We may know it,</hi> then ſurely we may have more then a conjecturall knowledge, even a certaine knowledge of our happy eſtates; and were there no more Arguments in the world to diſcourage a man from Popery, this were ſufficient, even this very doctrine of doubting, and conjecturall aſſurance of a mans eternall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which leaves a mans Conſcience deſtitute of any peace. Conſider therefore,<note place="margin">Rome an Harlot.</note> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is an Harlot, and brings up ſtrange children; when ſhe doth not teach her children to know God to be their Father, it argues ſhe is no lawfull ſpouſe of Chriſt; but doe but hope ſuch an one is your Father, but count it preſumption to ſay, you know it. That Church that traines not up her Children to know God to be their Father; is a falſe Church; and a ſigne that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath mixed her ſelfe with ſo
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:117852:99"/>many Idols and abominations, that ſhee cannot teach the children of her Church, to know that they are the ſons and children of God, but condemnes them to the death, if they dare preſume to ſay, that God is their Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. May refute that opinion of the Papiſts, that will not ſuffer the common people to heare this Scripture; take notice here how injurious they are to the faith of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to the knowledge of their chiefeſt comfort, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar them of the knowledge and meanes of their ſalvation; take away theſe Scriptures, and take away the principall meanes of the knowledge of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. To teach ſuch as are in any doubtfull temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at any time about their firſt eſtate and condition, who are not able to apply with comfort aſſuredly their grounded knowledge, that Chriſt, and eternall life is theirs; It may teach them among other Scriptures, to be diligent in inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into this Epiſtle, the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, it was the maine ſcope of his writing unto all thoſe that truſt upon the name of Chriſt, that they might know their bleſſedneſſe to lye upon him, and thoſe that did not certainely know they had found him, he writes to them to look after Chriſt, to long for him, and to deſire after him. Doeſt thou then de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire not only to beleeve eternall ſalvation belongs to thee, but to know it? for <hi>to know is ſomething more then to beleeve.</hi> A man may beleeve a thing, and upon good ground he may looke for ſalvation there, and waite for it, and deſire that he may be more aſſured of it, but to <hi>know that thou haſt eternall life;</hi> and the certainty of it, that God hath ſealed it up to thy ſoule and conſcience, of which thou needeſt doubt no more, this is a far more greater bleſſing then to beleeve in Chriſt, though by beleeving we have eternall life; and therefore if thou ſo beleeve in him as to looke for ſalvation in him, and not elſewhere, though as yet thou beeſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thy eſtate, yet thou mayeſt learne much by reading theſe Scriptures, read them againe, and againe, and leave not reading and ſearching into them, till thou finde even from this Epiſtle ground of aſſurance.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. May ſerve to teach the Children of God to know
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:117852:100"/>when you have made a good uſe of reading theſe Scriptures, you read much and often, and you thinke when you have done you have done God good ſervice. An uſuall vanity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians if they have prayed in the morning, and read a peece of a Chapter, they thinke they are better bleſt all the day after for it; and wee are unquiet all that day when we have not had time to read, and pray, but if that be done, we thinke we have quit our ſelves well; but a man may read, and never conſider what he hath gotten by it; a man may pray, and never obſerve what anſwer God makes to his prayers all the day long, but God requires that you ſhould get knowledge by reading, and that not of ſmall matters, but of your poſſeſſion of everlaſting life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you read to purpoſe, when you thereby come to know that you have eternall life, and your joy is increaſed, and you are brought on to beleeve and truſt in the name of Chriſt more and more, and unleſſe you ſo read you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this bleſſed Ordinance of God in vaine; and therefore be diligent and converſant in reading theſe Epiſtles, and as you would ſearch for treaſure, ſo be diligent and laborious herein, <hi>that you may know you have eternall life.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>John,</hi> when he writes the Goſpel, he ſpeakes as wel to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as to others, but cheifly to beleevers, John 20.31. <hi>Theſe things are written that you may beleeve.</hi> Say not what is this, but to make the worke that is already wrought, for though faith and beleeving, bee wrought in the hearts of Gods people, yet ſuch as doe beleeve, had need to be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to beleeve more and better, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. It is not onely the power of God to worke faith in ſuch as beleeve, but to lead them on from faith to faith, from one meaſure of faith to another, and the Goſpel is revealed from heaven for that end, that ſuch as beleeve not might be brought on to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. And ſuch as do beleeve, may be carried an end in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, ſuch as are faithful, had need be yet more faithful; you read alſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.25. <hi>I ſhall abide with you, for your furtherance and joy of faith,</hi> ſuch a furtherance as is for the increaſing and augmentation of your faith, ſo that there is not only faith but increaſe and growth of faith too: as furthered by the Goſpel, 1 Theſſ. 3.10, <hi>That I might ſupply the defects of your faith,</hi> to ſupply what is wanting in your faith, there is not any
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:117852:101"/>of the ſervants of God, no not thoſe that receive the word with much joy in the holy ghoſt, in much affliction and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, no not thoſe that give good pledges and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their grace, as 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6, 7. yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting or lacking in your faith, not any, no not the moſt exemplary Chriſtians, v. 7. but there is ſomething wanting in their faith, and therefore to this end he deſires to come to them,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> as verſ. 10. <hi>he is preſſed exceedingly night and day,</hi> ſtirred up unto that duty, with much vehemency and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe of ſpirit deſires exceedingly <hi>to ſee your faith, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what is wanting</hi> in it. A marvellous thing, that the beſt Chriſtians ſhould yet have ſomething wanting in their faith, ſo that this is not a needleſſe work he undertakes, in writing to them that beleeve on Chriſt, that yet they may beleeve better.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Now what is that which they had need grow unto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, they had need to grow unto the beleife of ſome further principles of Gods truth, ſome further Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith, which yet they know not: Some have need to grow in the object of their faith, to beleeve more then they yet doe beleeve. Some of the Apoſtles did not beleeve the reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, unleſſe he might ſee and feele, <hi>John</hi> 20.25. he was wanting in the beleefe of one Article of faith, the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead, and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the whole Church was wanting in this and in many other Articles of their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith; they doubted not but that their bodies ſhould riſe, but they wanted that before. And the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> they wanted this in their faith, they could not tell what to make of the long delay of the ſecond comming of Chriſt; they did expect a ſuddaine comming, and therefore many of them were troubled in their minds, ſo as that they neglected their callings, and minded not their outward buſineſſe in the world, expecting a ſuddaine diſſolution of all: And therefore the Apoſtle ſupplies what was wanting in their faith, by acquainting them further of the councel of God. That Chriſt muſt not come to <hi>Judgement, till Antichriſt have firſt come, with all deceiveableneſſe, and lying wonders,</hi> and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:117852:101"/>till the Church have made an Apoſtacy, and the <hi>Galathians,</hi> they were ignorant of the Doctrine of Juſtification, for ſupply of which, and ſatisfying them therein, that whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle is ſpent; ſo in all other Churches the Apoſtles la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to ſupply what was wanting in the object of their faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is ſomething wanting in their approved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the habit of faith, ſomething wanting in the gift and grace of faith. The Apoſtle prayes for the <hi>Coloſſians, That as they have received Chriſt they would ſo walke, and that they might be rooted and eſtabliſhed in him.</hi> Many of them were not ſo rooted and eſtabliſhed in Chriſt as they ſtood in need to be, not able to exclude and baniſh thoſe doubts, and feares, and cares of ſpirit, that ſometimes accompany beleevers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe that beleeve already on the name of Chriſt, yet there is ſomething wanting in the root of their faith; for looke as you ſee it is with a Plant, that is grafted into a Stock, it doth not forthwith take root, but a little matter will ſoone unſettle it; ſo is it in this caſe, a man may in ſome meaſure be implanted into Chriſt, and yet for a time be marvellouſly unſetled, and farre off from that rooted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which God lookes our faith ſhould grow unto, and ſo in a building, it at the firſt framing may be ſo greene, as that yet it is not ſetled upon the foundation, but it would have a time to be dryed and withered, that it may ſtand the firmer on the foundation without ſhrinking, and be more fit for a mans dwelling, ſo is it ſometimes with the faith of a Chriſtian man, he may be knit to Chriſt, and may have a place in Chriſt, but his morter may yet be green, and may be eaſily ſhaken with wind and weather of temptation, and not be yet <hi>rooted and eſtabliſhed;</hi> there may want ſuch holy confidence, and aſſured perſwaſion of fellowſhip with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as we had need to be lifted up unto a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe of faith, which this Epiſtle, and ſuch other Doctrines as theſe be, are wont to work in them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It may be increaſed in the comfort of it, in the ſence and feeling of it, for it may ſo fall out, that many a good ſoule may come to a large meaſure of a lively faith in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:117852:102"/>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as that they may cleave to him, and ſeeke him early, and doe and ſuffer any thing for the name of Chriſt, and yet ſometimes doubt, whether their faith be ſound hearted or no; in ſuch a caſe he doubts whether his faith be true or no, he wants the ſence of his faith, for he beleeves not that he hath faith; now this faith of his had need to be increaſed in the ſence and feeling of it, that he may plainly ſee the faith he hath is no fancy, or preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or deluſion, as he hath very much ſuſpected; but that he may ſee the faith he hath is the faith of Gods Elect, he had need be built up in his faith more and more: <hi>Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, help thou my unbeleefe,</hi> Mark 9.40. He could not tell whether he might call his faith, faith or unbeleefe, he could not tell what to call it, he was willing to beleeve, but it was with ſo much difficulty, and ſo much impotency of faith, that he prayes for the removall of his unbeleefe; ſo that in regard of the doubts that a man hath many times of his own faith, he had need grow up in faith, that he may beleeve that he doth beleeve, and this is that you read, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.25. <hi>For the joy of your faith.</hi> This was ſomething in which they were to be furthered, it was the joy and comfort of their faith; ſo to riſe up in beleeving, as that they might have comfort in it, for ſo farre as a man beleeves, and yet is doubtfull of it, he hath little comfort and joy in his faith, and therefore the Apoſtle would have them <hi>furthered in their joy,</hi> that their faith might be a joyfull faith, ſuch as where in they might have comfort, and might be joyfull for that they had received faith.</p>
            <p>And fourthly, faith had need be increaſed, in reſpect of the acts, the proper acts of faith, which are chiefly <hi>perſwaſion</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> upon the name of Chriſt, and thoſe heavenly truths, in which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is revealed, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly diſpenced unto the hearts of his people, even theſe alſo had need to be marvellouſly inlarged in Chriſtian men, above what at the firſt they doe ariſe unto; ſee them both put together, <hi>Peter</hi> when he walked upon the water he was fully perſwaded, and did truſt upon Chriſt for protection in a very doubtfull and dangerous caſe, he did truſt upon him,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:117852:102"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.30, 31. but when the wind began to blow, and the ſtorme to ariſe, then <hi>Peters</hi> faith began to ſhrinke, and his body to ſinke, and then he cryes out, <hi>O Maſter, ſave me, elſe I periſh. O thou of little faith,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, to ſhew you, that a mans faith had need be further increaſed, for you ſee our Saviour rebukes him for his <hi>little faith;</hi> not only weake in the habit of it, but little in the proper act of it. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſhrinke in his perſwaſion, and in his truſt, and that was thought the <hi>littleneſſe</hi> of his faith; and ſo the two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples that went to <hi>Emaius,</hi> they looked ſadly to thinke of the death of Chriſt, and complaine of it to Jeſus, and when he asked them, <hi>why they looked ſo ſadly,</hi> they tel him the cauſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the death of Chriſt, and ſay they, <hi>we truſted this had been he, that ſhould have delivered Iſrael; O fooles, and ſlow of heart,</hi> verſ. 21, 22. &amp; 24. <hi>ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things?</hi> to ſhew you, that there is even in Gods owne ſervants that are true beleevers, ſomething to be ſupplyed in the acts of their faith, their perſwaſion and truſt is many times very much overwhelmed, ſo as that many times they call in queſtion the maine principles and foundations of their faith. <hi>We truſted this was he,</hi> but we are doubtfull whether we be not deceived or no, God knowes whether it was he or no; but we have juſt occaſion of doubting, for they thought the Meſſiah ſhould have lived forever, and now this is the third day ſince he was crucified, and we truſted this was he, but now he is dead, and hath laine ſo long in the grave, and we are therefore doubtfull whether this was he or no, and therefore in this regard faith had need be increaſed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Faith had need to grow, even that faith which accompanies ſalvation, by which we beleeve on the name of Chriſt, not only thus farre as hath been ſaid, but had need to grow in the fruits of it, for many times though faith may have ſome ſtrength and comfort, and put forth it ſelfe in ſome acts, yet notwithſtanding it may ſometimes fall out, and often doth, that even the faith of Gods people is much intercepted from putting forth it ſelfe, in thoſe lively fruits of faith which redound to the praiſe and glory of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Faith workes by love;</hi> now you know what you
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:117852:103"/>have heard of the love of Gods people, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their firſt Love, yea ſo farre depart from it, as that he may fall ſhort of the performance of his firſt workes of his faith and love together, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.4, 5. Faith at the firſt was more abundantly fruitfull then now it is, and ſo their firſt love was more abundantly fruitfull unto good workes, then now they are able to reach unto, but Chap. 2.19. it is ſaid of the <hi>Thyatirans, their workes was more at the laſt then they were at the firſt.</hi> It is a ſigne their faith was as much growing in fruitfulneſſe as the other was decayed, ſo that ſomething may be ſupplyed to the faith of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their faith and love, and the fruits thereof had need to be increaſed; ſo that this is not a vaine end of <hi>Iohns</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them that beleeve on his name, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, though they now beleeve, yet they had need to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve yet more, though it may ſeeme to be a Tautologie, yet it is an evident truth.</p>
            <p>Now then for further opening of this point, firſt to ſhew you, that all which at this time hath been ſaid, may be one reaſon of the point why <hi>Iohn</hi> writes thus to them, which is taken from the defects that are found in the faith of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, which it were meet and neceſſary ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. It is taken from the marvellous power that is in this Epiſtle, and ſo in other Scriptures, to ſupply theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that are thus wanting in our faith, whether in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, or in whatever elſe; there is a marvellous power in the holy Scriptures to ſupply it all, and indeed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſo carved out, and ſo diſpenſed, and when diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced aright there is a mighty power in them to ſupply faith, and the defects of it in every Beleever, <hi>The Scriptures are mighty through God,</hi> whether <hi>preached</hi> or <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>heard,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred</hi> upon, or <hi>meditated</hi> upon; for to my remembrance, the Scriptures are ſanctified of God to none other uſe but to one of theſe five; the Word of God is mighty, and mighty to this end, that beleeving in the Word, whether prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or heard, or read, or examining what you have heard, or meditating, or conferring upon it, there is a mighty
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:117852:103"/>power in the holy Scriptures to ſupply the faith of Gods people.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mighty power in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note>Firſt, For Preaching, there is a mighty power in the Scriptures preached, for he writes theſe things that they may be preached, and to be read, and to make uſe of them in conference, and meditation, and in them all there is a mighty power. But firſt for preaching, Rom. 1.16, 17. <hi>The Goſpell is the power of God to ſalvation, for therein is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God revealed from faith to faith.</hi> By the Goſpel of God preached, the Righteouſneſſe of God is revealed from faith to faith, to lead on beleevers to beleeve, and not to reſt growing in beleeving, til they reach unto ſalvation; it is the <hi>mighty power of God to ſalvation, to every one that beleeves,</hi> ſuch an one, while he lives ſhall be of the thriving hand in faith. And when the Apoſtle prayed ſo earneſtly, night and day to come againe to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> Doth hee not therein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, though there may be a mighty power in the word read to increaſe faith where it is already wrought, yet his perſonal preſence would helpe it much more, whether by <hi>conference</hi> or by <hi>preaching,</hi> and therefore he prayes much to ſee them again. An evident argument, though the word read may be of much uſe to eſtabliſh us; yet much more the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal perſence, and conference and preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, elſe that prayer of his had been ſomething imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>And ſo ſecondly, for conferring of the Scriptures, you know when the two Diſciples were doubtful whether that was the Chriſt or no, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.21. our Savior doth not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for that doubtfulneſſe, but he begins at <hi>Moſes, and opened to them the things written in the Prophets,</hi> till in the end <hi>their hearts glowed and burned within them,</hi> and that was a furtherance of their faith, for then they preſently ran to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then they do not ſay, we truſted this was he, but they ſay, <hi>the Lord is riſen indeed:</hi> In very truth without any further diſſention, never diſtruſted it more, <hi>he is riſen indeed,</hi> ſo that there is a mighty power in the word confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, in private conference, and therefore they doubt no more of it: So that the word opened by way of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:117852:104"/>made their hearts to burn within them, they do not call it preaching, but rather a private conference, an applying the Scripture to this point they ſtood need to be inſtructed in, and they go away with ful reſolution, <hi>the Lord is riſen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you know the mighty power and uſe of the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Phillip</hi> with the Eunuch upon that conference, the Eunuch <hi>beleeved and was baptized,</hi> Acts 8.37. So that take the word preached, and there is a mighty power of God in it to lead a Chriſtian man from faith to faith: And take the Goſpell of God and conferre about it, and it is a mighty power to increaſe faith, that beleevers may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Reading the word.</note>Thirdly, And ſo it is for the word read, another kind of diſpenſing this word, that is a ſpecial end of it, that <hi>by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you might beleeve on the name of the Sonne of God,</hi> that is the next uſe of the Scripture, they which do read, ſhal by reading finde their hearts confirmed, and eſtabliſhed in the faith, <hi>John</hi> 20.30, 31. There is a mighty power of God that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the word of God read, to ſtrengthen men in the faith, that ſuch as beleeve already, may beleeve more, and bee eſtabliſhed in their perſwaſion of the truth of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you ſhal examine the things that you have heard,<note place="margin">Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things heard.</note> that is another uſe of the Scriptures, an examination of what you heare; goe home and conſider whether the things that have been taught were true or no: whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the holy Scriptures or no; for a Preacher ſpeaks not the expreſſe words of the Scripture, but comments and explications of the Scriptures, and therefore examine whether that which is delivered be agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are alledged for to prove the doctrine. We muſt make uſe of the Scripture as a rule to meaſure all the Sermon by we heare, whether it be of juſt length and breadth of Gods word or no, as the ballance of the Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, the two teſtaments be, and when you weigh what is ſaid, then you are confirmed and eſtabliſhed in it.</p>
            <p>Now this kind of making uſe of the Scriptures to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:117852:105"/>what you hear, it is of ſpecial uſe to helpe forward the faith of ſuch as do beleeve, yea, (and which is more) it may bring on men to beleeve, which it may be never did beleeve before, mightily ſtirred before, but beleeved not, til they goe home and ſearched the Scriptures, ſeeing that which is ſpoken to be fully agreeable to the word of God, they have been brought on wonderfully to beleeve; famous is that of the <hi>Bereans,</hi> Acts 17.11, 12. <hi>they heard the word,</hi> and what he ſpake they <hi>received it gladly,</hi> they thought he ſpoke well, but <hi>they ſearched daily to ſee whether thoſe things which were ſpoken were ſo or no,</hi> therefore ſee the bleſſing of God upon it, verſ, 12. <hi>many of them beleeved,</hi> they received the word with reverence and did not cavell at it, but heard it patiently, and when they came at home conferred about it; and when upon examination they ſaw it was according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the holy Prophets, when they ſaw, that what <hi>Paul</hi> preached was ſuitable to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, the bleſſing of God was great upon them, for the number of them that beleeved was not a few, to ſhew you that a man that hath heard the word, and hath been ſtirred with what he heard, if he ſhal go home and conſider and weigh well, and ſee how one thing bears witneſſe to another,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> ſo as that the word preached, opens the word written; and the word written, confirmes the word preached, then though before he was doubtfull, as ſometimes a godly mans heart may faile him in applying the word to himſelfe, as <hi>Jacobs heart failed and he beleeved not,</hi> yet when he conſidered it, and ſaw what tokens of love was ſent him, and laid circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, <hi>then his ſpirit revived.</hi> So a man heares much, and ſome thing pertinent to him, yet his heart may faile him, and may have much adoe to gather any comfort out of it, but when he conſiders things more privately and <hi>ſearches the Scriptures,</hi> upon examination,<note place="margin">Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> many a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves the word, which before he was doubtful of. Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and examination of the word, is marvellouſly bleſſed by God to this end, to helpe forward our faith, it is of good uſe both to beginne, and to increaſe faith; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to worke it, where it was heretofore wanting, much
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:117852:106"/>more to increaſe it where it was begun before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we were begotten by the immortall Word of God; ſo no Word of God, being diſpenſed in any Ordinance of God, none of them but are of mighty uſe for the ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our defects of faith, and to make us beleeve more.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the Word.</note>Fifthly, the Word alſo meditated upon, when a man hath heard it, and ſearched it, and beleeved it, read and conferred about it, or ſay none of theſe for the preſent, but whether theſe have gone before or no, for the preſent the very meditation of Gods Word, which a man now takes into his minde as he is riding, or working; there is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power in the Word, pondering upon it, and chewing of it, to make a man more rooted in it, more fruitfull, and more comfortable in beleeving. This truth you ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. when a man <hi>meditates upon the Law of God day and night,</hi> he growes to more delight in it; one of theſe helps another, and what will be the fruit of it? <hi>He ſhall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters,</hi> planted and rooted, and well watered there, and he <hi>brings forth his fruit in due ſeaſon, and whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper;</hi> not as planted in a dry Wilderneſſe, but by the <hi>rivers of water,</hi> and that makes him not only well rooted, and growne tall, but it inables him to bring <hi>forth fruit in due ſeaſon,</hi> and as for his <hi>leafe</hi> it <hi>withers not,</hi> neither Summers heat, nor Winters Froſts makes it to fall, but he ſtill holds his greenneſſe, and his fruitfulneſſe, and he growes in all the graces of God which tend to the praiſe, and glory of his grace, and this is by reaſon of his delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and meditating in the Word of God, and thus you ſee the point opened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Firſt then, you may from hence gather a ſigne of tryall of your owne faith, for if this be the Spirit of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Teacher to draw on thoſe that are beleevers to beleeve; it is a good ſigne, as of a faithfull Miniſter, ſo of a faithfull Hearer, when he deſires to ſupply the defects of his owne and others faith; you ſee <hi>Iohn,</hi> a faithfull Miniſter to thoſe Chriſtians to whom he writes, he when he had brought them on to beleeve, and found faith wrought in their hearts, it was his care not there to leave them; he doth not ſay
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:117852:104"/>as ſome would, well, there is now truth of grace in them, and truth of faith, ſuch faith as accompanies ſalvation; and now he that begun this worke in them will finiſh it, and ſo leave them; and you ſay, now you need take no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care about them, but now they will doe well enough; no, this is not the ſpirit of a faithfull Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and it will be but uncomfortable to ſuch Miniſters, as thinke now they may be left to the wide world,<note place="margin">Property of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</note> they wil ſhift any where, but where we ſee any ſeeds of faith begun, we muſt be deſirous to increaſe it in our ſelves, and ours; the Apoſtles themſelves pray, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith,</hi> Luke 17.5. and ſo they deſire to increaſe other mens faith, wee had need grow faſt this way if we would have a true ſigne of a lively faith, true and lively faith always deſires to grow in it ſelfe, and it would cauſe the like faith alſo to grow in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and therefore as you ſee faithfull Miniſters are thus deſirous to grow themſelves, and to cauſe others to grow, as <hi>Paul</hi> prayes <hi>exceedingly night and day, to come to thoſe</hi> whom he had taken pains withall, <hi>that he might make a ſupply of what was wanting in their faith,</hi> and as faithfull Miniſters muſt cloathe themſelves with this earneſt deſire, to be calling yet more and more upon beleevers, that ſuch as doe beleeve may beleeve yet more, and grow from faith to faith. Truly ſo godly Chriſtians, looke as Miniſters are deſirous to grow in their owne faith, and to helpe on others, ſo in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, it is a true ſigne of faith, not to content our ſelves in truth of faith, but to deſire earneſtly after growth in faith, had not they cauſe to pray that <hi>Paul</hi> might come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them againe and helpe them? And therefore, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this is that which every true beleever hath reſpect unto, every faithfull Chriſtian prayes for himſelfe, <hi>Lord increaſe my faith,</hi> Lord helpe my unbeleefe, this is the prayer of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoule that comes to Chriſt, that though we have ſome meaſure of faith already, yet mixed with ſo much unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and unſetledneſſe, and ſo many defects, that every Chriſtian hath cauſe to pray, Lord helpe my unbeleefe; ſometimes a man is hindred with offences, and they are to be avoyded, in which a man will not be able to put forth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:117852:105"/>love unleſſe hee have a ſtrong faith, and that was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Apoſtles prayed ſo earneſtly <hi>Lord increaſe our faith,</hi> Luk. 17.5. for it was upon this occaſion our Saviour had been exhorting them, how to carry themſelves in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of offences, <hi>if thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee rebuke him, and if he repent forgive him, &amp;c.</hi> Now they apprehended, it was a great work, they ſaw it was a great worke to <hi>rebuke him,</hi> he had need have much faith before he can do that, but ſuppoſe upon that a man doe humble himſelfe, and <hi>repent,</hi> then for a man to <hi>forgive him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note this.</note> it requires a great faith to forgive a wrong, or an injury offered to us; but what if he come and offend me againe, and againe, ſeventy times ſeven times? why if he doe, and ſay it repents me, <hi>thou ſhalt forgive him:</hi> Now when they heare this, that a man muſt bee ſo free-hearted in forgiving wrongs and injuries done to themſelves, they had need have a ſtrong love, and ſtrong love ſtands in need of a ſtrong faith, to ſhew you, that a man that ſhal have occaſion to trade with his faith, and to live and walke by his faith, he ſhall have much need of the growth and increaſe of it, <hi>if it be but for the healing of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,</hi> many occaſions and temptations may meet with us in the world, temptations from Satan, as well as from the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.14. And if a man have ſtrong enemies, he will ſtand in need of a ſtrong faith, to cut aſunder all the <hi>fiery darts of the Devill,</hi> Epheſ. 6.16. <hi>Above all take the ſhield of faith.</hi> There is no man willing to go to the field with weak armour, he would if he could have armour of proofe, ſuch as might repulſe a weapon or a dart caſt againſt him, ſo a Chriſtian he hath to fight againſt many enemies; And a <hi>ſheild</hi> covers his whole body, and ſo differs from a buckler, that covers but one part, but a ſhield covers the whole man ſtands upon the ground, and covers him all over, and now faith being ſuch a ſheild, it is of mighty force, and is able to repulſe all the <hi>fiery darts of the Devill,</hi> and all the reſt of the enemies of their ſalvation, ſo that the ſervants of God, that know what uſe they have of their faith, they know they have need of the growth and increaſe of it.</p>
            <p>And ſo againe, in regard of their daily imployments,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:117852:107"/>
               <hi>the juſt man lives by his faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17. Gal. 2.20. A man doth nothing Chriſtianly and ſpiritually, but by his faith,<note place="margin">Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to all things.</note> now when faith muſt be the inſtrument to helpe us to work all our workes ſpiritually, we had need to grow to ſome life and fruitfulneſſe in faith, and if our faith be not fruitfull, we ſhall make but hard work of our daily imployments, how ſhall we depend upon God, and do all in the name of Chriſt, and doe all in obedience to a commandement, and live by a promiſe, for Gods preſence and bleſſing in it? how ſhall a man do this if he have not faith, yea if he have not ſome dexterity of faith? A weake faith will then ſlug it, when a man ſtands in moſt need to uſe it: and therefore that a man may be ready to ſhew his faith upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in prayer in conference, in every thing both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this life and another. A man had need of a great deal of faith, and therefore this is an evident ſigne that a mans faith is well wrought, a ſound, and a lively faith, if it be a growing faith: But if you heare men ſaying, they thanke God they have a ſtrong faith, and they alwayes beleeved on Chriſt; and fie upon them that doe not, let me ſay, this is a <hi>preſumption of faith,</hi> but is no faith, yea, it is the badge of the want of faith, when therefore you ſee the Apoſtle writes to them that beleeve, that they may beleeve more certainly, and more ſtrongly, that is a true faith, and it will grow.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2, It ſerves to reprove the moſt ſacrilegious and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable faith of the Papiſts, that take away theſe writings from the people, <hi>John</hi> writes this Epiſtle to the intent, <hi>that beleevers may beleeve,</hi> you heard that the word diſpenſed in any ordinance is of mighty power to increaſe faith, where it is begun, and to beget it, where it is wanting.

And therefore an infidell practiſe to go about to take away the faith of Gods Elect. God ſent us the Scriptues to the end that we might beleeve, and if this be the nature of faith, to deſire that themſelvs and others might grow in faith, what are they but Infidells in truth, who as much as in them lyes lock up the Scriptures in a ſtrange
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:117852:108"/>tongue, that the people may not underſtand what is read unto them, and as much as in them lyes drives the Bibles out of their houſes. And it is heretical preſumption for ſuch and ſuch men to uſe the Scriptures, this is infidelity, and moſt ſacrilegious to God: And it is likewiſe uncharitable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the faith of Gods people.</p>
            <p>An evident argument of infidelity, how can you charge the wiſdome of God of more folly, and lightneſſe? God ſends his word to his ſervants, that they might be reading, and hearing, and conferring of it; and that by beleeving they might beleeve: Theſe men to caſt an imputation of folly upon God, they are afraid that God did not conſider the danger of it, if beleevers ſhould fall a reading, and poore tradeſmen a conferring about the Scriptures, they are afaid they will be diſtempered with hereſie, and ſo trouble the whole Church; do not they by ſo doing set the wiſdom of God at naught, and ſhew themſelves ſacrilegious againſt the truth of God?</p>

You that have been diligent in hearing and reading the word, be diligent in it ſtil, and make it a point of your Chriſtian practiſe, not to faile to read ſome part of it every day, unleſſe you be neceſſarily hindred, or if you have been neceſſarily hindred by buſines from reading, yet be ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder you from meditating upon it, <hi>the bleſſed man me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates on Gods word every night, and every day,</hi> &amp; though he takes the ſhorter time to it, yet he muſt have ſome time for <hi>medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon the word, upon ſomething he heard this day, or ſomething hee hath ſometimes read, and you ſhall finde a mighty power in it to fructifie, as if you were <hi>planted by the Rivers of waters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mighty power in meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the word.</note> for the ſpirit of God <hi>breaathing in the word,</hi> and your hearts <hi>ſucking it up,</hi> and by meditating upon it, you grow in more knowledge in the object of your faith, in the rootedneſſe in the ſence, and in the acts and fruites of your faith, and this by hearing, and reading, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:117852:106"/>read therefore, <hi>the King himſelfe muſt doe it daily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kings muſt read the Word of God daily.</note> who hath more buſineſſe then any man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19. And if he doe ſo, God will learne him the feare of his name; now if God will not excuſe <hi>Kings,</hi> much leſſe private men, who have leſſe affaires then <hi>Kings</hi> have; and therefore be reading every day, and when you cannot read, be ſure you <hi>meditate</hi> upon ſome part of Gods Word, <hi>every day, and every night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ever you deſire to beleeve, uſe the meanes that you may beleeve, this being ſanctified of God to that end, then be not you wanting to uſe it; and doe not only ſo, but heare it likewiſe, and conferre upon it, and ſearch it daily whether it be true or no; uſe the meanes that God hath ſanctified his Word to be diſpenſed in, and by which he will bleſſe it to his people, and then you ſhall finde this: <hi>In beleeving you ſhall beleeve,</hi> you ſhall grow from faith to faith, and from ſence to ſence, and in the fruits of faith till you be perfect in Chriſt Jeſus: be diligent in hearing Gods Word, for <hi>it is the mighty power of God unto ſalvation;</hi> and conferre of it, there is a mighty power in the Word being conferred upon, take heed ye neglect not occaſions in this kinde, and <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> and examine what you heare, and you will finde a mighty power in it to increaſe faith; Since therefore God hath given you his Word, and ſhed abroad the water of his Spirit, to run through every line of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> ſo that the more you ſhall read, and heare, conferre, and meditate, and ſearch the Scripture, the more you ſhall finde the life of faith increaſed in you; and therefore you muſt not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if you ſee Chriſtian men that neglect theſe duties, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the deadneſſe of their hearts. Doeſt thou doubt in thy perſwaſion, is thy confidence mixed with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? then aske thy heart this queſtion; Whether haſt thou uſed the Scriptures for thoſe ends God hath appointed them, and haſt thou been diligent in conferring about them, and ſearching of them, whether what is delivered be ſuitable to them or no, and meditated of them, and brought them home to thy houſe, and compared them together, and <hi>meditated upon them day and night,</hi> and taken times to chew and digeſt them? If thou hadſt done thus, then thou wouldeſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:117852:107"/>have beleeved more aſſuredly; but if we be negligent in any of theſe kinds, then wonder not, if we take away bodily food, we take away bodily heat, take away the fuell that nouriſhes faith, and then it muſt needs grow weake and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. And therefore as you deſire to grow in beleeving, be diligent in theſe duties, that <hi>you may beleeve on the name of Chriſt,</hi> and in beleeving may beleeve much more. And for you that doe not beleeve ſavingly, whoſe faith will not put you <hi>in poſſeſsion of eternall life,</hi> though this Scripture was not ſo much written for your uſe and benefit,<note place="margin">Note this.</note> as for them that already beleeve, yet ſince there is no meanes to come to faith but by the Word, be not you wanting, as ever you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to come to that faith which <hi>accompanies ſalvation;</hi> be not wanting diligently to heare the Word of God, and conferre about it with thoſe that beleeve already, <hi>Faith comes by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> Rom. 10.17. and it is <hi>the mighty power of God to ſalvation.</hi> Be glad of any opportunity to heare the Word, and waite at the <hi>poſts of wiſdomes gates,</hi> Prov. 8.34, 35. <hi>He that findeth me findeth life,</hi> the promiſe is very plaine, <hi>waiting daily at my gates.</hi> Implying, that in hearing we ſhall finde him, and in finding Chriſt we ſhall finde life; be diligent therefore to heare, and when you have heard it goe home, and ſearch whether it be true or no; and if you have liberty be doing this often, be conferring about it, as you can have any opportunity; God hath ſanctified theſe Ordinances to this end. Be diligent in <hi>inquiring after wiſdome,</hi> after Chriſt in the Scripture; there is a treaſure lyes, digge for it and you ſhall have it, eſpecially if with all theſe you joyne humble and hearty prayer to God for a bleſſing upon all theſe Ordinances, for 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. they are all <hi>ſanctified by the Word, and Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.2, 3. God would have you to uſe Prayer, intreat him to open your eyes and hearts, that you may beleeve and obey, and that no Ordinance might be in vaine to you, but might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them all, and might grow <hi>up in beleeving.</hi>

                  <bibl>1 JOHN 5.14, 15.</bibl>
                  <p>And this is the Confidence that we have in him, that if we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</p>
                  <p>And if we know that he heareth us whatſoever we aske, we know that we have the petitions that we deſired of him.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Verſe the Apoſtle deſcribed to us, the maine ſcope of his writing this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, which was partly, that Beleevers might know that they did beleeve, and partly that they might <hi>beleeve on the name of the Sonne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this latter end <hi>Iohn</hi> aymes at in writing this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, he exhorts Beleevers to imbrace it by three ſeverall Motives in the verſes following, the 14, 15, 16. verſes.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>1</label> The firſt Motive is taken from the confidence of ſuch as beleeve on him for ſalvation,for the obtaining of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, <hi>This is the confidence that we have in him;</hi> meaning, we that beleeve on his name, that if we aske any thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, he heareth us.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>2</label> Secondly, Another motive or benefit that flowes from this, is this; That if <hi>we know he heareth us, we know we have the things that we asked of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, here is likewiſe added another motive taken from the prevalency of his Prayers with God in ſuch a point, as wherein of all others we may finde this comfort; and that is, look as by beleeving on the name of Chriſt, we ſhall finde comfort in reſpect of our everlaſting eſtate; ſo we ſhall finde this further benefit, that if we <hi>ſee any Brother,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:117852:109"/>which hath ſinned a ſinne, that is not unto death,</hi> not a deadly ſin, that is, not the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſo mighty and prevalent ſhall our prayers be with God, that in caſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on the name of Chriſt, and aske pardon of ſinne for our brothers offence, <hi>God will give him life;</hi> ſo that if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on his name, our prayers ſhall be heard, and they have a prevailing power with God to obtaine at his hands the pardon of all our brothers ſinnes, that have not ſinned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.</p>
            <p>The Doctrines hence are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Firſt, <hi>That a prayer that is made well, never ſpeeds ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus: <hi>A prayer that is made according to Gods will, is ever granted according to our will;</hi> or, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>according to our deſire,</hi> verſ 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Secondly, <hi>Such as beleeve on the name of Chriſt for ſalvation, may be confident, and certaine of the hearing and granting their petitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>A prayer made according to Gods will, ſhall be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to our will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſo ſaith the words of the Text, <hi>If we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> We praying according to Gods will, ſhall finde acceptance according to our will. Notable is that ſpeech of encouragement and acceptance of our Saviour to the woman of <hi>Syrophenitia,</hi> Matth. 15.28. <hi>O woman great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> She had prayed, as Chriſt would, according to Gods will, and ſhee received anſwer according to her deſire. As if a man that did beleeve, and had a ſpirit of Prayer, and had learning to pray according to Gods will, he might be able to carve for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the treaſures of Gods goodneſſe, as if God would let him into the chamber of his preſence, of his grace and favour, and bid him take what he will, take for himſelfe and his friends, and for his brethren as he will.</p>
            <p>For opening of this point obſerve thus much; Firſt, let us ſee what it is to pray according to Gods will; and then ſecondly, what is the ground of the point.</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:117852:109"/>
            <p> For the firſt, to pray according to Gods will,<note place="margin">To pray according to Gods will in two things</note> are contained in that Phraſe, and yet divers things beſides thoſe are comprehended in it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when he ſaith, according to his wil, it implyes firſt, <hi>That we pray for ſuch things as God wills,</hi> ſuch things as are not according to his ſecret will, for ſo we cannot guide our actions, for <hi>ſecret things belong to the Lord our God;</hi> but of things revealed, it is according to his revealed will, and it implyes, that we ſhould aske him nothing but what hee gives us Commandement to aske, all that he commands us to doe, as to aske that we may aske, and for that we are to pray for expreſly; As for the glory of his Name, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his Kingdome, and the building up of his grace in any, the doing of Gods will, for our daily bread, &amp;c. Theſe are the things he hath given us warrant to pray for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, According to Gods will, this is evident; That whatſoever we aske, we ſhould aske it with ſubmiſſion to the will of God; ſo our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. He asked that which was a lawfull thing, and yet becauſe he would not trench upon that which might croſſe the will of his Father, he would not put forth any the leaſt affection of his ſoule to the over-ruling the Counſell of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he expreſſeth himſelfe thus; <hi>Nevertheleſſe not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> So that whenſoever we aske any thing that is lawfull, it muſt be with ſubjection of our owne wils to the will of God. But for more full clearing of this point ſee it thus inlarged.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a man is ſaid to pray according to Gods will, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partly as his will is expreſſed in his Word, and partly the will of God, expreſſing the worke of the Spirit in the heart of a Childe of God, for both theſe are effectuall in every prayer that is made according to Gods will.</p>
            <p>Firſt, according to his will expreſſed in his Word;<note place="margin">1. Aske things lawfull.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God requires that we ſhould pray only for ſuch things as are lawfull, and ſuch as therein he hath commanded us to aske, that we may doe them. Notable is that example in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.4, 5. <hi>Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments diligently;</hi> and in the next verſe ſee what is his requeſt,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:117852:110"/>
               <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keep thy Statutes;</hi> looke what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God commands us to doe, we have warrant to pray for that, we muſt pray for things lawfull, and only for ſuch.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Aske in Chriſts name.</note> Whatſoever we pray for, we muſt pray in the name of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.22, 23. he makes a large promiſe to ſuch as ſo aske in his name, verſ. 23, 24. <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall aske the Father in my name he will give it you.</hi> This God requires, that we ſhould put up all our petitions in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now to aske in the name of Chriſt doth require the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of two graces.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He that ſhall aske in the name of Chriſt, implyes the asking of it in humility;<note place="margin">1 To aske in Chriſts name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth humility.</note> whatſoever we aske in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and lowlineſſe of ſpirit; that is, to aske in the name of Chriſt; and that will evidence and put forth it ſelfe in three or foure ſeverall acts in every prayer that is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will, and put up in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Firſt act of humility.</note>Firſt, A prayer made in the name of Chriſt is made with this humility, whereby we acknowledge our ſelves leſſe then the leaſt of all Gods mercies, as <hi>Iacob</hi> doth acknowledge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. He was leſſe then the leaſt of all the mercies he had already received. And therefore if God ſhould never grant him more mercy, he could not but acknowledge he had done abundantly more for him already then he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; he prayes not in his owne name, but in the name of another; and no man can pray in the name of Chriſt, but he muſt pray in humility, he muſt have no confidence in his owne worth.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Act. </seg>2</label> Secondly, he muſt pray in the ſence of his owne inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, ſo much as to thinke a good thought, much leſſe to make a good prayer, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. This is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſelfe-deniall, when a man comes before God, and acknowledgeth his owne unworthineſſe to aske any mercy of God, and confeſſeth his owne unableneſſe to aske any bleſſing according to Gods will.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Act. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, A man askes in humility, when he puts up his petitions with ſubmiſſion to Gods will, he deſires not that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:117852:110"/>God would ſatisfie him in any luſt, but only grant him the things that are expedient for him, ſo farre as may ſtand with the good pleaſure of his heavenly Father, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Act. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, There is another act of humility, to bend the heart of a man to make uſe of no mediation in prayer, but only the mediation of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; you read of a pretended humility, <hi>a voluntary humility,</hi> conſiſting in the <hi>worſhip of Angels,</hi> Col. 2.18. They thought themſelves not worthy immediatly to ruſh into Chriſts preſence, but rather intreat the Angels, to intercede the Father for them; but it is counterfeit humility, and ſuch men are puffed up with a fleſhly minde in their voluntary humility; it ſhewes, that it is a vaine pride of heart, to expreſſe more baſeneſſe and meanneſſe of ſpirit then God requires, and is but a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit humility.</p>
            <p>Now to pray in the name of Chriſt, is not only to pray in humility, but alſo to pray in faith, and theſe acts of faith you have in all the prayers that you put up to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Faith directs you to pray only unto him,<note place="margin">Firſt act of faith in prayer.</note> upon whom you have beleeved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. We only beleeve on God the Father, and on his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and the bleſſed Spirit, and therefore upon the Lord; Faith only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to call; he teacheth us not to pray to our Mother, as the Papiſts doe; nor to our Brethren, and Siſters, as the Papiſts doe to the Saints and Angels, but only to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that is the voyce of faith, <hi>Gal,</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>The Spirit helps us to cry, Abba father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Act. </seg>2</label> Secondly, It is the nature and worke of faith in every prayer, it doth guide the heart of a man to looke unto God with ſome kinde of childe-like confidence, repairing to him as a Father; ſuch as by faith beleeve on the name of the Son of God, they come to God in their prayers, as to their Father, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. And it is the nature of faith to cry out as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> John 20.28. So that this is another worke of faith, that when ever you come into Gods preſence, to aske any thing at his hand,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:117852:111"/>you come to him as to your Father, he knowes what you want better then you can aske, and is more willing to grant whatever is meet for you, then your ſelves can deſire to come to God as our heavenly Father, through Jeſus Chriſt, is an act of faith, he is ſo wel acquainted with us in him, that himſelf loves us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.26, 27. So that to pray in faith, is to come to God as the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and through him a Father alſo to us, abundant in goodneſſe and in truth; a Father that is great in counſell, and excellent in worke; that hath compaſſion of his owne Children, and wil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore performe that which ſeemes good in his ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Act. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, Another act of faith, and that is for a man to come truly cleaving to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, not to ſtand upon demurs, and diſputes, whether we had beſt cleave to God, and whether we had beſt doe ſuch or ſuch things, and ſo be almoſt Chriſtians; for if we ſo come, we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing at the hands of God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>A wavering minded man is unſtable,</hi> &amp;c. This is one, and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of the meaning of it; he ſpeakes of ſuch a kinde of wavering faith, as whereby a man is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a heart, and an heart;</hi> he hath a minde to draw near to Chriſt, and to become a ſervant of Chriſt, and yet withal a mind to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after ſome ſinfull luſt or other which takes up his minde, and which his ſoule luſteth after; and therefore he is unſtable in all his wayes; ſometimes he is for God, and ſometimes for himſelfe, ever halting between God and the World; but let ſuch men thinke they ſhall not receive any thing at the hands of God, this ſhould have been in the ſecond place.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Act. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, Faith hath reſpect unto this; to beleeve that what we have asked according to Gods will, he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly give it us, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.24. <hi>Beleeve that you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and you ſhall receive it;</hi> meaning, ſo farre as you have commended your Petitions to God, in the name of Chriſt, with ſubjection to the will of your heavenly Father; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, that God hath reſpect to your poore eſtate, and he will doe for you what you deſire, yea even in thoſe things wherein he ſeemes to delay an anſwer; but in the meane
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:117852:111"/>time, for your part make account your prayers are heard, in that very bleſſing you deſire, for God doth wiſely pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not onely the hearts of the ſons of men, but all the words of their lips, and he knowes the meaning of the ſpirit in the hearts of his children.</p>
            <p>And though wee muſt expreſſe our ſelves in words, in our deſire of this and that bleſſing, yet God lookes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally at the grounds of our deſires, and wherefore we deſire to obtain the bleſſing: What it is, that moves us to have a deſire after ſuch and ſuch a mercy, and obſerving well the byas of our hearts in ſuch requeſts, he doth in this reſpect conſtantly hearken to his ſervants, and failes not to grant us the things we aske, even when he ſeems to deny us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. he ſpeakes of the prayer of Chriſt, <hi>he was heard in what he deſired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was hee heard in? why, hee prayed, that <hi>if it were poſſible the cup might paſſe from him.</hi> And was he heard in this? did not he drink it to the very dregs? did he not taſte of Gods deepeſt diſpleaſure? and how is he then ſaid to be heard? why the Father did conſider what it was that his Sonne did deſire, which was principally that Gods will might be done, and not his own.</p>
            <p>And Gods will being done, Chriſts deſire, being that Gods will might be done, he was heard in the thing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. And againe, he was heard in the thing ſo far as it concerned himſelfe, as to be ſaved from that which hee feared; that though he did drink of the cup, yet he ſhould be ſaved from being overwhelmed by thoſe feares, which his ſoule trembled at, and groaned under, and preſt him heavily, even unto the very death, though not from taſting of them, yet from being overwhelmed of them, and he was ſupported in them, ſo that Chriſts main end being the doing of his fathers wil, and the redemption of mankind, in theſe things, he was graciouſly heard: And ſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> he prayed that if it might be Gods will, he might goe over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and ſee that good land, his end was to ſee that good land. Well, God ſaid in diſpleaſure, he ſhould not go over, and yet in mercy he anſwers his requeſt, for his deſire was to ſee that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:117852:112"/>good land. Now God could make him ſee that good land, &amp; never carry him over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and he ſhewes him all the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> all the coaſts of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the one end thereof to another, God ſo ſtrengthened his ſight this way, as one would not have thought it credible, but that God was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to grant him his deſire, and ſtrengthened him beyond what he deſired, ſo ſhall you obſerve Gods manner of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his ſervants, if we be content to pray according to the will of God, and bow our ſpirits to aske nothing but what is lawfull, and with ſubmiſſion to Gods will, and run to God as our heavenly father, in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and look at him as one more ready to give, then we to aske, then make account God will ponder all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of your ſoules, and weigh well what you have ſaid, and he knowes what you aime at in asking this, and that bleſſing: and though he may ſeeme to deferre it, he better knowes your need of it, then your ſelves doe, and when he ſeemes moſt to croſſe it, then doth he moſt abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>the Lord was angry with him, and would not heare him,</hi> and yet he did heare him; he limited God to a means to ſhew him that good land, but he need not appoint God a courſe: <hi>Moſes</hi> knew hot how he ſhould ſee it, unleſſe he went over, but God knew how he ſhould ſee it; So that even thoſe prayers, with which God ſeems to be angry, in regard of ſome infirmity, that God may ſee in our prayers, yet this we are to make account of, that even then, when God is diſpleaſed with our poor petitions, even then doth he anſwer them moſt graciouſly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.23, 25, 26. <hi>God was wroth with me, and would not heare me, And he ſaid ſpeake no more to me of that matter.</hi> It was a marvellous ſtrange kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Gods fatherly counſell to <hi>Moſes:</hi> that when he is angry with ſome weakneſſe in our prayers, and ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe in us to deſire, or have, this or that; ſee his carriage: <hi>Moſes</hi> his words provoked God, and therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deſires to go over <hi>Iordan</hi> to ſee that good land; God was wroth, and God would not have him goe, and yet he ſhould ſee it, he ſhould have as much as he deſired, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:117852:112"/>the Land he ſhould not goe; ſo that come with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in prayer, that though our prayers be ſuch as for which God may be angry with us, yet many times God heares thoſe prayers, and anſwers them in mercy, farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what we could have thought; for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw as much of it as could be ſeene, and he could not have ſeene ſo much of it if he had gone over <hi>Iordan,</hi> as he did then ſee. Conſider therefore, God markes the very bent of my ſoule, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in every petition I put up, and therefore obſerving what I deſire, he will accordingly grant either the thing I deſire according to my deſire, or that which I ayme at in my deſire, and this is a glory to the name of Chriſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we ſhould aske in our owne names would be thruſt out of heaven; yet this magnifies the name of Chriſt, that a Chriſtian ſoule beleeving on his name, and laying hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and cleaving to him, and ſhall come to God, as beleeving that God is more ready and able, and willing to grant, then we to aske, and that he will grant us the very petition that we deſire; this doth magnifie the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and this is to pray according to Gods will, as expreſſed in his Word.</p>
            <p>But now in the ſecond place, there is ſomething in our prayers made according to the will of God, as is expreſt in the ſpirit of him that prayes, for this you ſhall finde ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in Scripture, that men that pray, pray in the ſpirit, Jud. 20. <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Pray in the ſpirit;</hi> And you know what the Apoſtle ſaith in that well knowne place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. <hi>We know not what to pray for, nor how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit helpeth us, &amp;c.</hi> God ſearcheth the heart eſpecially in prayer, he knowes the meaning of the Spirit, for he maketh requeſts according to the will of God, that is the words of the text; ſo that if you would aske how we may pray according to the will of God? looke what is revealed in the breathings of the Spirit, which marvellouſly declares it ſelfe in the wraſtling, and longing deſires that it puts up to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>My ſoule longeth and breatheth after thee;</hi> and it lets us know what the will of God is, and for that the Spirit helps us to pray.</p>
            <pb n="218" facs="tcp:117852:113"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Firſt, to pray in the ſpirit is to pray fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</note>Now to open this a little; Firſt, you ſhall diſcerne the will of God by the breathing of the Spirit, firſt when the Spirit helps us to pray feelingly, and ſenſibly for thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that we ſtand in need of, when the Spirit doth lift up our hearts, and reach after thoſe mercies we ſtand in need of, in ſome feeling and ſenſible manner. The will of God is revealed in the breathing of the Spirit, that ſtretches forth it ſelfe in ſuch an humble and faithfull manner, as that the ſoule is very ſenſible of its need of it, we poure out our ſoules before God, for what we ſtand in need of in feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſires, and this good <hi>Hannah</hi> expreſſed in her prayers, 1 Sam. 1.15. <hi>I am a woman of a ſorrowfull ſpirit, I have poured out my ſoule before the Lord.</hi> To ſhew you, there was an inward ſenſible worke of the Spirit of God in her heart that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large her, not ſo much to poure out words, as ſighes, and groanes; this feeling power of the Spirit doth mightily expreſſe what the will of God is that we ſhould aske, this is according to the will of God, according to what you read, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.9. <hi>With my ſpirit within me will I ſeeke thee early;</hi> my ſpirit within me, that is to ſay, he ſpeakes as if there were a ſpirit within his ſpirit; beſides the inclination God had given and wrought in him to the wayes of grace, and beſides, his ſoule that did animate his body, <hi>the Spirit of God within him;</hi> with that ſpirit will he ſeeke God early in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſpirit will inwardly be working, and turning him towards God; ſo then, this is the firſt thing wherein God reveales his will to us, and we pray in the ſpirit; which we doe, when we pray in the ſence and feeling of our own wants of thoſe bleſſings we want at Gods hand, that is, by a certaine ſtrength, greater then any of our owne ſpirits can reach forth themſelves unto; the Spirit of God comes, and helps us to wraſtle with God, with ſighes and groanes that cannot be expreſſed; that we thinke more then we ſpeake, and we ſpeake more then we thought of.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently.</note>Secondly, beſides this, this ſpirit helps us to pray unto God with fervency, and heate of ſpirit, ſo much as that in ſuch a caſe as this we ſtrive with God in our prayers, and wraſtle with him; <hi>The effectuall fervent prayer of the righteous
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:117852:113"/>availeth much,</hi> Jam. 5.16. When the Spirit of God helps us to fervency, to cry to God, and to be earneſt with him in that regard, and not to give him over, and comes from a ſenſible want of the bleſſings we ſtand in need of, and that makes us goe out of our ſelves to God, for the mercy that is according to the will of God, and this in Scripture is called wraſtling, and ſtriving with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. when you grow ſenſible of your owne danger, and you ſtrive with him for the bleſſing; this is to expreſſe fervency of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and this was commended in <hi>Iacob,</hi> that <hi>he wraſtled with God,</hi> Gen. 32.24, 26. which is expounded, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. that <hi>he prayed and wept;</hi> his wraſtling was chiefly in prayer with teares, that God would be mercifull to him in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.

Pray upon all occaſions for every thing that you ſtand in need of, and never give over til you be heard and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Parable teacheth thus much from the <hi>unjuſt Iudge;</hi> Shall a ſinfull mortall man be moved with impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and ſhall not God ariſe, and be moved for thoſe poore ſoules that <hi>cry unto him night and day?</hi> yes doubtleſſe, though you may thinke God is not ſenſible of your prayers, but he reſts himſelfe quietly in heaven, and remaines in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of glory, who is bleſſed for ever in himſelfe, and will not trouble himſelfe with ſuch poore requeſts as yours is; but let me tell you, this woman did not ſo much trouble the Judge here, nor could be more troubleſome to him, then a poore Chriſtian is to God, that wraſtles with him in prayer: God cannot be quiet in heaven for ſuch a ſoule, but in the end he muſt riſe and ſatisfie its deſire; ſo you have the like, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.8. to 13. <hi>If you continue knocking he will riſe,</hi> and ſo will your heavenly Father doe for you much more, ſo as that though God might ſeeme to be aſleep, and reſt himſelf ſatisfied in that bleſſed eſtate he enjoys in another world, and no more regard things below then men aſleep,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:117852:114"/>yet if you continue knocking and begging, you wil diſturbe his peace, till he ariſe and ſhew mercy to you, and this he ſpeakes after the manner of men, to ſhew you, that he doth as unfeignedly, and as deeply take to heart the deſires of your ſoules, as any of you can doe one of another; and therefore be conſtant and perſevering in prayer, and never give over; when we have a good petition in hand never give over, when we pray for pardon of ſin, or for peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or for ſtrength of grace for our ſelves or for others, when we pray for the healing of our ſoules, or our bodies, for the Church or Common-wealth, whatſoever we have in hand, if the Spirit of God doe but move us this way, it is for us never to give over untill God ſhew mercy to us in ſome one kinde or other, that we may ſee our requeſts was not neglected, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Watch thereunto with perſeverance,</hi> verſ. 19. where you ſee what courſe God would have his Servants to take, take this courſe, ever follow God, watch night and day, and never give over till he bleſſe you and yours, untill he bleſſe Magiſtrates, give Miniſters a doore of utterance, that they may ſpeake ſavingly, and powerfully to the ſoules of their Hearers, ſo as that as it were you may weary God, and prevaile with him to ariſe, and give you your deſire. Wherefore is it thinke you that Chriſt calls prayer <hi>knocking?</hi> but for this very end, to manifeſt unto us, that when we continue praying we continue knocking, and we make as a loud noyſe at Heaven gates, as any man that knocks at your houſe doores, and God ſo eſteemes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7. <hi>For to him that knocketh it ſhall bee opened.</hi> So that if God doe but give us hearts to knock, and to be inſtant and conſtant in prayer, for that is knocking, if we be fervent and perſevering in prayer, and ſpring from our feeling and ſence of want of the bleſſing, and what comfort it would be to us to obtaine it, and give him no reſt untill we receive at his hands what we aske of him; to him that thus knocketh it ſhall be opened. So did the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Syrophenitia,</hi> ſhe knockt hard at our Saviours doore of mercy, <hi>have pitty, have mercy upon me;</hi> and when at the firſt Chriſt anſwers her not a word, ſhe then cryes out againe,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:117852:114"/>
               <hi>Lord helpe me;</hi> and when thereupon he tells her, he was not ſent to her, but to <hi>the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> Did ſhee then leave off? No, ſhe would not be put off, when he then told her, it was not <hi>meet to take the childrens bread and to caſt it to doggs;</hi> Shee ſaid, <hi>Truth Lord, but yet the doggs eate the crumbs that fall from the table;</hi> Why then ſaith our Saviour, <hi>be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> Like as a man that is weary of a Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. As if he ſhould ſay; Why, if thou beeſt ſo importunate that thou wilt have no deniall, if it muſt be ſo, why goe thy way, and be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And when God gives us ſo to pray as not to give over, we may know for a certaine, God intends to give us a gracious anſwer in all the deſires of our ſoules, and this is to pray according to Gods will.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeake of the ſecond part of the Doctrine, and that is the reaſon why a prayer thus made is ever granted, <hi>pray well, and ſpeed well.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Firſt, becauſe in praying according to Gods will, God doth but fulfill his owne will in fulfilling yours; as this is the will of God, that all thoſe things that are lawfull for us to aske, and expedient for us, it is his will that wee ſhould pray for them; it is Gods will, that we ſhould pray with ſubmiſſion to Gods will, that we ſhould pray humbly and feelingly, and conſtantly; now if we have prayed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, then his will muſt needs be done; and his will is, that now our wills ſhould be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. This reaſon is taken from the faithfulneſſe of God in the promiſe, and from the ſuitableneſſe of Gods will to ours, when we ſo pray.</p>

Now if Chriſt give us to uſe his name, looke whatever petition we put up, and uſe his name in it, it is now the prayer of Chriſt; for looke as if any of you ſhould ſend your childe or ſervant to any of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:117852:115"/>your neighbours to deſire ſuch or ſuch a favour from them, you ſend them, but the petition is yours; they deſire it in your name, and if you ſend him, and bid him uſe your name, and then you are ſure it will be granted; and if he ſhould deny your childe or ſervant of ſuch a petition that he askes in your name, in denying him he denies you, ſo that God cannot deny the petition you aske in Chriſts name; for <hi>him he heareth alwayes,</hi> and all ſuch petitions he hath promiſed to heare. The word of promiſe you heard before, and it is full to this purpoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you;</hi> He takes his owne truth to witneſſe it, as a ſolemne aſſeveration: <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aske the Father in my name he will give it you.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Aske in my name that you may receive.</hi> If therefore the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doe but give us this encouragement, that we faithfully give up our ſelves to become his, and in ſence of our owne unworthineſſe to aske any thing at Gods hands. And we come to the Father as being ſet a worke by Chriſt, and beſeech him to anſwer us in this and that mercy, and cannot give over till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our prayers, and reach us an anſwer of them, then the promiſe ſtands good, <hi>Aske and you ſhall receive.</hi>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, It is taken from Gods acceptance, not only of Chriſt, but of the Spirit, the Holy Ghoſt alſo; for that is much to be conſidered, for there is no prayer that is ſo wrought in this ſort, nor any prayer thus put up, in ſence, and feeling, and breathing of the Spirit in the name of Chriſt; but it is the prayer of the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe, and God that knowes the meaning of the Spirit, he hearkens to all the requeſts of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. <hi>The Spirit it ſelfe makes interceſſion for us,</hi> ſo that theſe prayers are not only received and gratified, becauſe they are put up in the name of Chriſt, but alſo becauſe the <hi>Spirit it ſelfe makes interceſſion for us, according to the will of God;</hi> and <hi>God knowes the meaning</hi> and voyce of his owne Spirit, God knowes that without this we could never be fervent for any ſpirituall bleſſing, according to the will of God; our dead hearts would ſoone make dead worke of it, if there were no ſpirit in our prayer but our owne, if our fleſh be weake we
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:117852:115"/>ſhall ſoone have done, and therefore when God ſees us pray thus feelingly, &amp; are not willing to leave him til he anſwer us in our deſires, then God knowes, there is a mighty power of a ſpirit that ſpeaks in us, and God cannot deny the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And further to ſtrengthen this point, Chriſt himſelfe tels us, that he will pray in our behalves for us; for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe ſits at Gods right hand making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us, <hi>John</hi> 16.26. <hi>At that day yee ſhall aske in my name, and I ſay not unto you that I will pray the father for you, for the father himſelfe loveth you, becauſe you have loved me, &amp;c.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſweetly expreſſeth how the Lord Jeſus prayes for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemned, it is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us,</hi> ſo that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt takes up our prayers, as our mediator: As the great maſter of Requeſts, and he dreſſes and perfumes them from all that ſinful frailty, and coldnes that uſually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth our prayers, he perfumes with the merits of his own ſufferings, and ſo preſents them before the father with his own worth in his ſight, and ſo they come to be accepted in the ſight of God, ſo you read <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. howſoever that may be verified in ſome tipe of Chriſt on earth, yet eſpecially it is meant of Chriſt in heaven, he perfumes the prayers of the Saints, and expreſſeth his owne will to the father, as beſeems the majeſty of the Sonne of God: And as a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, he perfumes our unſavoury prayers, and preſents them to his father, ſo as they become accepted in his ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Simile.</note>As if an elder brother ſhould ſet a child one of his younger brethren to get his father a poſie of flowers, and the child out of ignorance, ſhould gather ſome weeds and put in it: And the elder brother gathers out the weeds, and ſprinkles the flowers, and then preſents them in the childs name to the father. So doth Chriſt to us, while we gather up Petitions here and there, and as we thinke for the beſt, and ſome truth and work of grace there is in them, yet ſome
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:117852:116"/>weeds of ſinfull folly, then Chriſt takes them out of our hands, and pulls out the weeds, and ſprinkles them with the blood of his croſſe, and the merit of his ſufferings, what he hath don and ſuffered for us. And ſo by this means it is not poſſible that our prayers ſhould be rejected.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. It may ſerve to teach us all, As ever we deſire, we or ours might ſpeed well, ſo to learne to pray well. No one can ſpeed ill, that can pray well.</p>
            <p>If you can but pray, you neede aske no more for you and yours. If you or yours can pray well, they have enough; let them but ſpeake, and ſpeede; pray, and have; ſeeke, and finde. <hi>Oh woman bee it unto thee, even as thou wilt!</hi> In ſuch a caſe, God will accept you ſo farre, as to carry you in among the treaſures of his grace, the ſtore-houſe of his mercy, and there for to fill you with what you would have.

            <p>As <hi>Barnabas,</hi> exhorted them with <hi>full purpoſe of heart to cleave to the Lord,</hi> Acts 11.21. and if ſo with full purpoſe of heart you cleave to the Lord, you doe pray in ſome meaſure of faith: And then may you ſooner learne what God hath commanded you to do, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.4, 5. And this you ſhall finde of much conſequence, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we hearken to Gods commandements, ſo God hearkens to our requeſts, look with what eare you liſten to him, with the ſame eare he liſtens to us: If he ſee that we give up our ſelves to obſerve every word of God, then ſhall <hi>we never be confounded.</hi> If God ſee you have a tender heart, to all his commandements, he will have as tender a reſpect to all your deſires. And therefore be carefull, as firſt to grow to a free-hearted giving up your ſelves to Chriſt, ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten duly to what God commands, and then God will have a tender reſpect to every one of your petitions; when this is your firſt aime, then may you have reſpect to other things, God will then ſatisfie your ſoules in revealing to you his granting of all your petitions.</p>

Of Comfort to every ſoule, that hath given up it ſelfe to Chriſt, and do thus call upon his name, this is the confidence all ſuch have, they ſhall be ſatisfied according to their wills, many a ſoule that hath received a ſpirit of prayer, is many times much diſcouraged: And what is the matter? Why, this and that I have prayed for, but my faith is faint within mee for want of the thing I deſire; Why, but bee not diſcouraged, heaven and earth ſhall faile, but the word of God shal never faile, do but conſider what it is thou haſt asked, and know there is no prayer of thine, but it ſtands upon record in heaven, and God waits and ſtaies but for a fit and ſeaſonable time. Notable is that ſpeech in <hi>Daniel, At the beginning of thy ſupplication, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement went forth,</hi> It was ſent forth to grant thee thy requeſt but it was hindred ſo many daies, that it could not be don till now, from the beginning the prayer was heard, and the

            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>Such as beleeve on the name of Chriſt for ſalvation, may be confident and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the hearing and granting of their petitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a double Act and a double Object; the double Act is confidence and knowledge. And the double Object, is firſt, <hi>Hearing of our petitions,</hi> And ſecondly, the <hi>granting of our petitions,</hi> and both expreſly diſtinguiſhed in the Text.</p>
            <p>And ſo the poynt will be evident, <hi>Such as beleeve on the name of Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation,</hi> (for of them he ſpeakes in verſ. 13.) <hi>they may come to a confident, and certain knowledge of the hearing and granting of their petitions, and the having of them all fulfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To open this point unto you. And becauſe <hi>John</hi> doth ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this from the end of his own writing, for hee ſaith, hee wrote theſe things onely to them that beleeve in the name of the Sonne of God, for this end, That they might beleeve on his name.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let me ſhew you firſt, how theſe two great benefits, confidence and certainty of hearing and having our petitions, doth both ſpring and ariſe from what is here taught us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Which is the foundation of all the reſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:117852:118"/>ſpeaking of Adoption, ſaith he, <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath ſhewed on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God;</hi> he doth ſtand and wonder at the marvellous and incredible love of God, that he ſhould vouchſafe to ſtoop ſo low, and honour us ſo much; debaſe himſelf, and lift us up; not only ſtoop ſo low as to behold low things are on earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. but ſo low as to take up ſuch earth-worms as we be from the Dung-hill, and ſet us among the Princes of the people, ver. 5, 6, 7, 8. he not only beholds them with an eye of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but his people with an eye of fatherly compaſſion, and lifts us up to become <hi>ſonnes and daughters</hi> to himſelfe, and helps us to beleeve it that we are ſo.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt ground of the certainty and confidence of the hearing of our petitions, if once we may come to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that we are the ſonnes of God, upon which occaſion a great part of this Epiſtle is ſpent, this is the firſt ground, and theſe the Apoſtle is wont to joyne together, as the ground of all comfort in this kinde, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. ſo that to be perſwaded, or to grow confident that we are the children of God, will be a good foundation to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the hearing and granting of our Petitions. To whom may a Son come for any bleſſing but to a Father? and what makes him more confident of ſpeaking, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then this principle, that he knowes he is the childe of ſuch a Father as is willing, and able to help him?</p>
            <p>Secondly, another principle in this Epiſtle tending to build up this certainty, and confidence, is not only our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but likewiſe Chriſts advocation, 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>If any man ſinne, we have an Advocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Advocate what.</note>What is it to be an Advocate? To be an Advocate, is to plead on our behalves with the Father, for the granting and anſwering of our Petitions, for the pardoning and healing of all our tranſgreſſions, and the performing to us, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of us all the good things we ſtand in need of, whether we aske them, or aske them not; but eſpecially, there is no Petition we put up, but Chriſt takes it at our hands, and puts it up in ſuch forme to his heavenly Father, as that by
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:117852:118"/>and through him it is accepted; As a man retaines an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate in a Court, he brings him his cauſe rudely drawne, ſo as it would be rejected in the Court, but his Advocate puts it into ſuch a forme, as is agreeable to the Law, and ſutable to the order of the Court, ſo as it findes free accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: So we put up our Petitions rudely, and many times farre ſhort of that frame which God eſpecially lookes for from his ſervants hands, but Chriſt takes them at our hands, and puts them into forme, and ſo preferres them to his heavenly Father, and ſo as from thence we have good occaſion, and good ground of confidence and certainty, that whatever we put up in any meaſure according to Gods will, being preſented to our Advocate, to our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall be accepted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Attonement, or propitiation</hi> that our Saviour makes to our bleſſed Father, ſpoken of in the ſame place, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Attonement, or propitiation,</hi> the thing is this: That whereas many a ſervant of God might feare his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would never be granted, becauſe he hath been ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before God, and hath ſo many wayes diſhonoured God, that he knowes not however God ſhould heare ſuch an unworthy creature as he is. Now the Apoſtle ſets forth in this Epiſtle the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as our Attonement, that if we come to our Advocate, and ſay, We have ſuch Suits, and Petitions to put up to our heavenly Father, but we have ſo diſpleaſed him, that we thinke he will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard us; Why ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If any man ſinne, we have an Advocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> and therefore for our owne hearts, though we have juſt cauſe of diſcouragement in regard of our ſins, yet we have a <hi>propitiation,</hi> an <hi>attonement,</hi> he makes interceſſion for us as an Advocate; but you ſay, God will not heare him for ſuch ſinners as we be? Yes, he makes <hi>propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or attonement,</hi> that we periſh not by our ſins, nor that they ſhould hinder Gods acceptance of us, or granting our deſires, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of the firſt <hi>chap.</hi> and ſo here is a third ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of our confidence and certainty of our deſires.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is another, and that is the <hi>annoyntment that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:117852:119"/>we have received from him, by which we know all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.20. implying, that though we be dark in our owne mindes, and dead, and ſtraight in our owne ſpirits, and doe not know what the Lord or Chriſt hath done for us. Why yet we have received <hi>an unction from the Lord Ieſus,</hi> who will tell us what he hath done for us. As a mans Advocate, will ſend his Clyent word of all things how they goe in the Court about his buſineſſe, that he may know how farre he hath proceeded, and where they ſtick: So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is the holy one there ſpoken of; <hi>You have received an unction from him,</hi> he ſends downe his holy Spirit into your hearts, and lets you ſee and know all the petitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts that God grants you; you ſhall no ſooner have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition granted, but you ſhall have it certified to you by this <hi>unction</hi> of the holy one, whereby you know you have them granted, and for whoſe ſake it is that they are granted by this <hi>unction;</hi> you know all things pertinent to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. God ſends forth his owne Spirit into our hearts to let us know ſo much, and this is a marvellous point that the Holy Ghoſt gives us to know all things that are done in Heaven for us, and how farre God hath accepted us.</p>
            <p>Further, If you be inquiſitive to know, why the Spirit of God doth certifie the ſoule of this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Spirit certifies us of this, that ſurely our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are heard and granted, becauſe he hath given us an heart to pray, he hath helped us to pray, we could never have prayed fervently, and feelingly, unleſſe the Holy Ghoſt had helped us; we know we have ſtraight hearts, and if we therefore come and pour out our ſouls to God in any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affection, then we know we have this unction, the Holy Ghoſt came and opened our mouthes, and healed our lips, and made us pray affectionately, and feelingly; and that is a great light to the hearing of our petitions, for a prayer well made, is never ill heard, and therefore you know what is ſaid, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Thou prepareſt the heart to pray, and thou haſt heard the deſire of the poor.</hi> How ſhall a poor Chriſtian know that his deſire is heard? Why, thou haſt prepared the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:117852:119"/>heart to pray; If God prepare our hearts, then he <hi>will cauſe his eare to heare,</hi> theſe alwaies accompany one another; That is ſomething that this unction doth, it works in all our hearts to pray according to Gods will, and to pray in the name of Chriſt, and ſo ſatisfies us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Spirit of God that we receive from the holy one, it is alſo a ſpirit of faith, that inwardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us that God hath indeed heard us, and that he will doe for us whatſoever we deſire, and will ſometimes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beare witneſſe of it to the heart of a man, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 11.24. <hi>What thing ſoever ye deſire when ye pray, beleeve that ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and ye ſhall have them.</hi> We muſt beleeve that what we have ſaid to God he will certainly doe it, and the ſpirit of faith will come, and ſay to the heart, God in heaven ſaith Amen to it, he gives out a <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at,</hi> let it be done, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>David</hi> was in a grievous affliction, both in bodily affliction, and ſpirituall deſertion, as in the beginning of the Pſalme, <hi>He cryed out day and night,</hi> God had <hi>forſaken</hi> him, and his <hi>ſoule was ſore vexed; but thou O Lord, how long, &amp;c. And now away from me all ye mine enemies, for the Lord hath heard my peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and he will accept me; ſo that even while he is in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complaints, and grievous mourning; while he is yet ſpeaking, this unction comes, and reveales to him Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of him, and therefore now he encourages him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and caſts a defiance upon all the troubles of his ſoule, he lookes at them all as vaniſhing away like ſnow before the Sun, and now he comforts himſelfe therein.</p>
            <p>And this oftentimes and uſuall, when the ſoule makes uſe of Gods Ordinances, and Priviledges which himſelfe hath granted, that ſurely God hath heard our requeſts, he never refuſeth to grant that prayer which he ſtands to heare; for this purpoſe is that you read of the good woman <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15. to 18. <hi>Ely</hi> ſuſpected ſhe was in ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but ſaith ſhe, <hi>I have poured out my ſoule before the Lord.</hi> She prayed feelingly, and fervently, and faithfully, not words, but her <hi>ſoule</hi> before the Lord; ſhe had prayed with her whole heart, and her ſoule did raiſe up it ſelfe heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the ſtrength of her deſire was ſet upon that; and he
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:117852:120"/>then ſaid, <hi>The Lord give thee favour in his eyes, and grant thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;</hi> which was, as if this anſwer had come from heaven, for God doth reveale himſelf in his Ordinances: She look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him as the high Prieſt, and ſo a <hi>Type of the Meſſiah</hi> and ſhe tooke it as a voyce from heaven, and the text ſaith, <hi>She went home, and looked no more ſad.</hi> God hath ſet it on, and ſpoken comfort to her heart, ſo as that her faith was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, ſhe ſaw the voyce of God in it, and went home re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon it, and takes ſuch encouragement to her ſelfe from thence as to feare no more in that kinde. When Gods ſpirit gives us to pray affectionately, and to beleeve confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, then we know we have our petitions, we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it.</p>
            <p>But beſides this cofident perſwaſion this followes, there is another worke of faith, and that is a conſtant wraſtling againſt all diſcouragements that falls between our requeſts, and the accompliſhment of our petitions. Famous is that ſtory of the woman of <hi>Syrophenicia,</hi> Matth. 15. from 23. to 29 you know the manifold diſcouragements ſhe met with, ſhe prayes, and at firſt God gives her no audience, <hi>anſwers her not a word;</hi> ſhe prayes againe, and then he gives her a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to grant her any ſuch requeſt, and tells her plainly, It is not ſutable to his calling, and therefore he may not apply himſelfe unto her; yet ſhe is not diſcouraged with this (which is very much) but ſhe followes him ſtill, and though yet reproached, and called <hi>a dogge,</hi> yet ſhe is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but out of the word of reproach gathers ſome hope of comfort; if ſhe be a dogge, why then let her have that which belongs to doggs, let her have but <hi>the crums that fall from the childrens table:</hi> Shee is not diſcouraged with all the difficulties that lay in her way, nothing ſhall cut her off from importunity, and when he could forbeare no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he then tells her, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> To ſhew you, that if the Holy Ghoſt doe but give a Chriſtian ſoule ſo much reſolution and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as not to give over praying, till God be pleaſed to give over anſwering, It is a good ſigne, this ſpirit of faith will certainly prevaile at length, <hi>All things are poſſible to them
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:117852:120"/>that beleeve,</hi> and not only poſſible but certaine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a third worke of this Spirit, and that is this; it workes as it is a ſpirit of hope, and that moves a man to waite upon God, that though God ſhould tarry long, and he ſhould pray heartily for ſuch and ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to be granted; in ſuch a caſe as this our ſpirits would be ſad and uncomfortable, and give over, and be ready to ſay, Wherefore ſhould I waite on the Lord any longer (as that prophane Prince ſaid, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. laſt,) having been long preſt with Famine, he in the end burſt forth with this, <hi>This evill is of the Lord, why ſhould we waite on him any longer?</hi> our foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh hearts ſoone grow impatient, and we cannot dance after attendance upon God; and therefore in this caſe though fleſh and bloud be ſhort winded, and ſoone weary, yet the truth is, this unction when it workes in us a ſpirit of hope, it ſtill waites upon God, it ſets it ſelfe to waite upon him, and is very well contented to ſtay Gods leiſure, though he ſhould tarry very long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4, 5. and 2 <hi>laſt,</hi> he ſets both morning and evening watch for him, and he is well contented to waite for him, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1, 2, 3. <hi>Our eyes waite upon the Lord our God;</hi> ſo that when God gives us a ſpirit of waiting, then doth he certainly ſeale up unto us the granting of our petitions, for when a man attends at the Court for an anſwer upon his petition, if the King bid him attend, it is a good ſigne he meanes to grant him his requeſt, elſe he would have rejected it; but a wiſe Prince, if he ſee a man come in good ſort, and deſire a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable requeſt of him, that ſuch a thing is according to his Princely will, and he bids him to attend and ſtay there, a ſigne he meanes to take it into conſideration, at leaſt, and good hopes it will be accepted. Now God conſults with no body, but if he give us a heart to waite and ſtay, aſſure your ſelves he meanes not to ſend you empty away, but it is an undoubted argument he will give us an anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou canſt thus waite upon him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a fourth worke of this unction, and it tends marvellouſly to the ſpeeding of our requeſts, and that is that which you read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.19. <hi>He will fulfill the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:117852:121"/>deſires of them that feare him.</hi> Doeſt thou finde that the Lord hath wrought a ſpirit of feare in thy heart, ſo as that thou walkes awfully before him, and in the feare of his name goes about every duty, and in his feare dependeſt upon him, and endeavoureſt to approve thy ſelfe before him? truly he will aſſuredly fulfill the deſires of them that feare him, when we reverence him in his Ordinances, pray with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and in an holy feare, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. Them that goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout holy duties in a reverent and holy feare, doe all things in the feare of the Lord, he hath a ſpirit of power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with God; this is ſuch a feare as whereby a man keeps Covenant with God, and conſequently prevailes with God to keep Covenant with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. This feare is it which makes us keep Covenant with God, this feare of God alwaies keeps poſſeſſion for God, ſo as that we dare not doe that which is unlawfull, we dare not ſinne againſt God, nor performe good duties careleſly, and feareleſly, for the feare of God bowes us to goe about holy duties, in an holy and reverent manner, and <hi>bleſſed is that man that ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alwaies.</hi> If therefore God take from us a wanton and wilde heart, a looſe and unreverent heart, and worke in us an awfull reverent feare of his name, in every duty of his ſervice, and our owne callings, that keeps us from depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from God, and it keeps God from departing from us, that we alwaies have him neare at hand, to heare all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of them that feare him. It is that ſpirit of which you read, ſpoken of concerning our Saviour, in which he ſhall proſper in all the workes of his hands, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11.2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, &amp;c. A ſpirit of power, and of the feare of the Lord,</hi> and that ſhall make him <hi>quick of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and ſo ſhall proſper, which is a bleſſing promiſed our Saviour, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to griefe, but the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> This is the end of this bleſſing, when God puts us to griefe and humiliation, and ſo workes in us the feare of his great name (which ever accompanies thoſe diſpenſations) then the worke of the Lord proſpers in our hands. If God give us a Spirit of his holy feare in any duty we goe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:117852:121"/>about, then it will aſſure us that God will heare our deſires.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, But yet further, there is a ſpirit of obedience, which doth marvellouſly ſeale up unto us the hearing and granting of all our prayers and petitions, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.22. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we aske we receive of him, becauſe we keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and doe thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> It is of neceſſary uſe, that when God gives us hearts to liſten to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word of his mouth, he will then liſten to the deſires of our ſoules, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.8. <hi>The prayer of the wicked is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord, but the deſires of the righteous are his delight, and he that turneth away his care from hearing the Law, his prayer ſhall be abominable.</hi> But if a man lend a liſtening eare to Gods Law, it makes his prayer acceptable; hearken to the Lord, and the Lord wil hearken to you, elſe not. It is to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what you read, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. latter end of the ſeventh verſe, <hi>Hearken unto me, that God may hearken unto you.</hi> If God gave them hearts to hearken to what he ſpake to them in Gods name, then God will hearken to them. If we ſpeake, and doe as <hi>Eli</hi> taught <hi>Samuel</hi> to ſay, <hi>Speake Lord, for thy ſervant heareth,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.10. If we come before God with ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that whatever God ſpeakes to us we will heare it, and doe it, we ſhall finde this upon it, whatſoever we ſpeake to God he will anſwer us, and worke it for us; ſo that an obedient Chriſtian is a powerfull petitioner, he is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in prayer. And this we may attaine to, by making uſe of this holy Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> that is written to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on the name of Chriſt; this is a fourth direction that <hi>Iohn</hi> gives us in this Epiſtle, whereby you ſee how mighty this ſame Epiſtle is to ſatisfie, and fill our hearts with ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> The reaſon of this confidence ſprings from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and the diſcerning of them clearly to belong to us, now all theſe things diſcover to us many promiſes, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſprings partly from Gods nature, and partly from Gods promiſe, and partly alſo from our owne experience, and theſe are the ſtaffe of our confidence; and from hence it is that we grow to ſee many promiſes belong to us, we
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:117852:122"/>ſee the nature of God become fatherly to us, and we from hence in time gather many experiences of Gods acceptance of us, and this ſtrengthens our confidence in his hearing of our petitions. Our Adoption aſſures us of Gods nature to be ours, whereby God takes us to be his Children, and he is one that is full of grace and goodneſſe, nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his part; he is a Father to us, and that is a great matter.</p>
            <p>And in regard that Chriſt is our Advocate and Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he brings all the promiſes to us, which in Chriſt are <hi>all, yea and amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1, 20. And this holy Spirit of God gives us experience of all that goodneſſe that is in God, and the truth in his promiſes, yea and it gives us experience in this alſo; that he <hi>that hath given us his owne Sonne, will not be give us all things elſe?</hi> Rom. 8.32. He gives us Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, fatherly Adoption, and effectuall Vocation to the wayes of his grace, and ſo he gives us experience of the greateſt matters, and from hence we know, that he will not deny us ſmaller things, as victory againſt the remnant of our corruptions, the greateſt part of them is ſcattered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſtaffe and ſtrength of them already broken, and we now conflict but with remnants of corruption.</p>
            <p>But now when the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, we know this, it goes farre; for confidence and faith ſprings from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of him that ſpeakes, or from the nature of him upon whom we truſt; but knowledge doth not ſo much ſpring from the teſtimony of any, either God, or man, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly gathered from ſence and experience, and experience is both a ground of confidence, and knowledge; and hence comes the knowledge of all Arts and Sciences, whence is their knowledge, but from their obſervation of many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences? Phiſitians know it, and they therefore ſet it downe in their bookes, they know it is ſo. Things that we gather from ſence and experience, we are ſaid to have the knowledge of; now this experience doth not only give us confidence but knowledge, for by the unction that we have received, we doe know the love of God that paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Chriſt dwelling in our hearts by faith, we come to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:117852:122"/>know the love of God towards us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17.19. There is not any thing that concernes the love of God towards us, but the Spirit of God dwelling in our hearts by faith, it comes to paſſe that we are able to comprehend <hi>the height, and depth, length, and breadth of the love of God</hi> towards us. This Spirit of God in our hearts gives us ſenſible experience and knowledge of Gods love to us, of his attonement and grace to us, our Conſciences that had hels in them before, all ſuch darkſome evils are now vaniſht and ſcattered, and we know that ſenſibly we had power given us to pray, and to beleeve that our prayers are granted; and can wait upon God, and feare God, and make conſcience of obeying his will. Now this Spirit of prayer that diſcovers theſe things plainly to our inward man, the ſence and experience of it makes a Chriſtian able to know what God hath done for him, and makes him able to beleeve what God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him; and thus now when we aske any thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will, he doth not only ſay, It is well ſaid, but he takes a courſe to anſwer our requeſts, we have certaine grounds to move us in what we aske, and the ends of our requeſts are right. Now God conſiders not alwaies ſo much the letter of our prayers as the grounds, and ends of them, the ſcope we ayme at, and God will ſo accordingly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Let it be firſt a ground of encouragement to every Chriſtian ſoule that beleeves in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, truſt not in your owne good parts, and good gifts, if any ſuch things increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them; truſt not in any worldly bleſſing, but beleeve on the name of Chriſt. And therefore that you may beleeve, humble your ſoules before him in regard of your ſins, and pray heartily in the faith of Chriſt. And why ſo? The ground is in the text, you ſhall not only be confident and aſſured of your ſalvation, which is a great mercy of God to my ſoule, and a greater then all the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would grant; they may goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and from one place to another to have ſought for pardon of ſin, and yet not ſo much comfort promiſed them, that after all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:117852:123"/>this they ſhall finde it, but in the end to Purgatory they muſt goe; and that is as ill as Hell fire (ſay they) ſave only in durance;) and this is all the helpe they have, they might whip and ſcourge themſelves, and give all their goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the poore, and themſelves goe in ſackcloth and aſhes all their dayes, and when all comes to all, they muſt not be ſure of any mercy or favour from God; which to beleeve would be Hereticall preſumption; but they muſt notwithſtanding all this reſt in Hell fire till the day of Judgement, unleſſe they will be at coſt to purchaſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from it; and (which is ſtrange) though they would not ſuffer them to beleeve a releaſe by Chriſts pardon, yet upon the Popes pardon they might have hope, and ſo they take more pains for an uncertainty, then we for certainty and knowledge, but you ſhall not only attaine certainty of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but certainty of the granting of all your requeſts; no peace to the peace of a Beleever, and therefore lay aſide all your confidence in the world, but be confident in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and be certaine of Gods favour and goodneſſe to you in him, and then here is ſuch bleſſings as will keep a mans heart warme in the worſt houres.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. To teach ſuch as beleeve on the name of the Lord Jeſus, how you may come to be confident, and certaine of the hearing and granting your petitions; How may wee come to that? Haſt thou good evidence to thy ſoule of thy Adoption, that God is thy Father, then meditate well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point, that Chriſt is thy Advocate, to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and Attonement for thee, in caſe thou haſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thy heavenly Father. Theſe two things will much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, they be ſtrong helps to a weake faith; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what unction thou haſt received, and look up to God that he would give thee a ſpirit of prayer, to pray feelingly, and fervently, and humbly before him, and then labour for a ſpirit of faith, which if God give thee ſo much faith as to perſwade thee, thy requeſts are heard, and to wraſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diſcouragements, and that the ſpirit of faith doth worke in thee grace to hope and waite upon God, and withall an holy feare of his name, and obedience to walke
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:117852:123"/>obediently in doing his will, and patiently to ſuffer his will under his hand; and obſerve how the Spirit ſpeakes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in this and that kinde, and it will be a notable means to helpe thee to grow confident, and certaine that all thy prayers are heard. Now many a Chriſtian ſoule falls ſhort of this, he conſiders not the Attonement of Chriſt in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but many times thus ſtands the caſe with them, there is much deſoluteneſſe in their lives, and looſeneſſe and fearleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their hearts before God, rejoyce not with trembling, God ſees his Servants looſe in their obedience, and when diſobedient they ſeek not to Chriſt for Attonement; whence it is that many times they are ſo full of doubts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Of much conſolation to all thoſe that beleeve on the name of the Lord Jeſus, and make uſe of theſe bleſſed meanes; this is our confidence, that whatſoever petitions we aske he heareth us, and we know it. See how comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Chriſtians eſtate is, he growes certaine not only of his owne ſalvation, but he is certaine of the hearing and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all his petitions, if he can but pray well, he makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all is well, let his diſtreſſes be what they will be.</p>

                  <p>If any man ſee his brother ſinne a ſinne which is not unto death, he ſhall aske, and he ſhall give him life; for them that ſinne not unto death. There is a ſinne unto death, I doe not ſay that he ſhall pray for it.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words containe a third motive to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us unto that duty which is the maine ſcope of this Epiſtle (to wit) to beleeve on the name of the Sonne of God; whereto the Apoſtle exhorts us, verſ. 13. and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds firſt this motive, to wit, A bleſſed confidence of the hearing of all our petitions. Secondly, a certaine knowledge verified, that he not only heares, but <hi>grants our deſires.</hi> Now he propounds a third motive in theſe words, taken from the benefit which by beleeving on Chriſt we ſhall in ſome meaſure be enabled, and made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of beſtowing the like bleſſing upon our brethren, and that by our prayers. If ſuch a man ſhould ſee his <hi>Brother ſin a ſinne which is not unto death, he ſhall aske, and he ſhall give him life.</hi> As an inſtrument, God at his requeſt ſhall give him life, God will make him an inſtrument of conveying ſpeciall favour to ſuch a man.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the words containe three parts; Firſt, a promiſe of obtaining life for ſuch of our brethren as we ſhall ſee ſinne not unto death, and ſhall aske life for him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an acception from this generall promiſe, he would have it underſtood of ſome ſpeciall tranſgreſſion, <hi>of them that ſinne not unto death,</hi> he would be ſo underſtood, and would not inlarge this promiſe ſo farre, as that a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:117852:125"/>man by his prayers ſhal obtaine pardon of ſinne for ſuch as ſin unto death, but not for that, that is the onely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he gives, leaſt this promiſe be taken to extend too far.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A prevention of an objection or doubt that might hence ariſe.</p>
            <p>For might ſome man ſay, <hi>All unrighteouſneſſe is ſinne,</hi> and every ſinne is a ſinne to death, and <hi>the wages of every ſinne is death,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>ult.</hi> And therefore if the promiſe extend only thus farre, to procure peace and pardon for ſuch as ſinne not unto death; then either you muſt grant ſome veniall ſins, or elſe this promiſe is of none effect, for if every ſin be mortall, and you onely promiſe pardon of ſin to ſuch as is <hi>not unto death;</hi> and no man ſins but it is unto death, this promiſe is of none effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> Anſwers to this Objection, verſ. 17. and ſaith, though <hi>all unrighteouſnoſſe be ſin,</hi> yet there is a <hi>ſin that is not unto death.</hi> It is true the deſerved wages of al unrighteouſnes is unto death, but there <hi>is a ſin that is not unto death,</hi> not that there is any ſin, which doth not deſerve death, but not that which doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly cut off a man from all hopes of life, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that ſin he may be converted. As ſometimes our Saviour ſaid of the ſickneſſe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> he is ſick, but not irrecoverable, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.4. So that the meaning of the Holy ghoſt is, that there is a finne unto death, which doth not onely kil the ſoule, but irrecoverably, out of which there is no hope of recovery or ſalvation, and that ſin they muſt forbear to pray for.</p>
            <p>This promiſe thus opened will afford us three notes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That a faithfull Chriſtian</hi> (or which is all one) <hi>a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever on the name of Chriſt, is not to hide his eyes from obſerving, and diſcerning the ſinnes, and ſlips of their brethren. If any man ſee his brother ſinne a ſin, which is not unto death,</hi> which he cannot ſee if he neglect to obſerve them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>A faithfull Chriſtian diſcerning the ſinne of his brother, is to pray for him, Let him aske when he ſees him ſin not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>A faithfull man praying unto Chriſt, for the ſinne of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:117852:126"/>his brother, ſhall obtaine life at Gods hand for him, pardon and peace and grace for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>A faithfull beleever is not to hide his eyes from obſerving the ſinnes and failings of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man ſee his brother ſinne a ſinne, he muſt obſerve him, elſe he cannot ſee him, Gal. 2.14. <hi>When I ſaw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them and diſcerned their courſe, hee turned not his eyes from beholding it, but he did take notice of it, Heb. 3.12, 13. <hi>Take heed leaſt there be in any of you an evill heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, in departing from the living God, take heed:</hi> hee doth not ſpeak of himſelfe onely, though that principally, but leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbeleefe, that is not only for every man to take heed to himſelfe, but to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren alſo, as appears by the following verſe, implying that a man ſhould not only take heed to himſelf, but as much as in him lyes, take heed to his brethren. And if you ſhould aske how ſhould I prevent another man, from having an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill heart of unbeleefe? he tells you how; <hi>By exhorting one another daily while it is called to day,</hi> looke to your ſelves, and alſo to your brethren, and ſhew your care of them, by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them up daily; And this is that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of in Hebr. 10.24. <hi>Let us conſider one another and provoke one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to love and good workes,</hi> ſee therefore and obſerve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſee where any thing is amiſſe, and ſtir up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to every holy performance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. It is firſt taken from the love we owe them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from the love we owe our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The love we owe to our brethren, God requires our love to our brethren, yea towards our enemies Oxe or Aſſe, we ſhould not ſee one of them fall under their burden or goe aſtray, and hide our face from them, Deut. 22.24. <hi>If you ſhould ſee the beaſt of your enemy to ſink down, you ſhall not paſſe by him and let him alone, but you ſhall raiſe him up from under his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:117852:126"/>burthen.</hi> Now if God require ſo much love to our beaſts, and that to the beaſts of our enemy, how much more doth God require this love to our brethren, that if we ſee them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the way we ſhould call them back againe? if we ſee them to ſinke under the burthen of ſinne, not there to let them lye, but though we could finde in our hearts there to let them lye, yet we ought not ſo to ſatisfie our ſelves, but to looke unto our brethren in ſuch a caſe, and doe the beſt we can to recover them from going aſtray.</p>
            <p>And in reſpect of our ſelves, this benefit we our ſelves ſhall have, we ſhall learne a more holy feare of the Lord, and have a more juſt jealouſie over our ſelves, we ſhall keep the better watch over our ſelves when we ſee our brethren fall before us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. <hi>Be not high minded but feare;</hi> to ſhew you, that when we ſee other men through unbeleefe, and corruption fall into any ſinne, we ought to benefit our ſelves thereby, not to be high minded upon this occaſion, to bleſſe our ſelves, and we thanke God it is not with us as it is with other men, we are not ſuch and ſuch as theſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans are wont to be, but feare we in ſuch a caſe, <hi>the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of others ſhould be the feares of Gods people;</hi> the more they ſee others fall, the more ſhould they ſuſpect their owne apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to faile in the like kinde. If ſuch things doe befall <hi>the greene tree,</hi> ſuch as are full of the Oyntment of the Holy one, how eaſily may the dry ſtubble kindle, ſo that what out of reſpect to learne the more to watch our ſelves, and out of compaſſion to our Brethren to reſtore them, what by ſeaſonable admonition, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. and what through prayer in his behalfe, it is a neceſſary duty of every faithfull Chriſtian man to obſerve the failings of his brethren.</p>
            <p>For further clearing of this point, let me firſt ſhew you with what an eye we ſhould looke upon their falls. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, come to anſwer an objection, and then to make uſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when you looke at the falls of your brethren,<note place="margin">Firſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall eye.</note> and have occaſion to behold them; looke not at them with a <hi>partiall eye,</hi> or an hypocriticall eye, as they in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5. but reflect we our eye upon our ſelves, and conceive
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:117852:127"/>that there is either the ſame or a greater evill in our owne boſomes, or at leaſt there is a pronneſſe in our ſelves to doe it if God ſhould leave us to our ſelves. A man ſhould never ſee his brother fall into any ſinne, but if he know himſelfe well, when he ſees <hi>a moate in his brothers-eye,</hi> he might <hi>ſee a beame in his owne;</hi> for though God leave not all his ſervants alike to fall into ſcandalous evils, yet there is found in them all a root and aptneſſe to all ſinne, that if God ſhould not reſtraine them, they would fall into as great evils as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have done. And hence a Chriſtian man that is ſenſible of this, he knowes there is not any thing found in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is ſingular, but he knowes that both himſelfe and all the reſt of his brethren are ſubject to the like evils, and that is an eye of ſincerity, by which we ſhould ever ſurvey the falls of our brethren, an eye that doth not ſo ſoone e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpy an evill in our brethren, but it ſees the like, or a greater in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As we muſt not behold their falls with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall eye,<note place="margin">Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye.</note> ſo neither muſt we obſerve them with a curious or <hi>cenſorious eye,</hi> for there is ſuch an in-bred vanity in the hearts of men, that we love to be prying into other mens frailties, and love to be buſie in finding fault with other men, not out of a deſire to amend them, but to reprove them, and to have ſomething againſt them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Be not many Maſters, for in many things we offend all.</hi> What is his meaning? his meaning is, Be not of a maſterly ſpirit, be not maſters of many perſons, to be every mans maſter is out of cenſoriouſneſſe, our natures are ready to ſift into every mans failings, and would ever be taxing of them, and that is the utmoſt end ſuch men aime at, not ſo much the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cleanſing of our brethrens ſins, but to be maſters o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; but my <hi>brethren, be not many maſters:</hi> As if this were the frame of our ſpirit, to be buſie as Maſters in an imperious manner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Neither with an envious and <hi>malicious eye,</hi> that is complained of by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Malicious eye.</note> he much complaines of it; when a man opens his eyes to obſerve curiouſly, and to pry narrowly, that if they could but finde him <hi>halting</hi> at any
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:117852:127"/>time they would recompence it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.10 When a man obſerves his brothers halting to heale it, but for this very end, that he may take advantage againſt him, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him, they did ſtare in his face, and they thought to be even with him, <hi>they watched for his halting;</hi> this was an envious and malicious eye.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Neither muſt I behold my brothers failings with a <hi>wanton eye,</hi> that is, when a man is not humbled for his brothers faults, but partly puffed up with it,<note place="margin">Wanton eye.</note> and prides himſelfe with beholding another mans failings, and thinkes every mans fall is a refreſhing to himſelfe; he builds his comfort upon the remembrance of the failings of his brethren, and his owne falling ſhort of them, this is an inbred vanity amongſt men; this the Apoſtle taxed among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.2. <hi>You have not ſo ſorrowed</hi> for it, ye have not been ſo humbled for it as ye ſhould have been, but rather <hi>have been puffed up; Puffed up,</hi> why ſo? what reaſon had they to be puffed up? Why only this, that they were not ſuch as he was, they had carried themſelves better then he had done, they compared themſelves with him, and in the ballance found themſelves better then he, and this puft them up. And this is a wanton eye, for a man may behold it with a wanton eye, either when he prides himſelfe in it, or is induced thereby to licenciouſneſſe, and are glad of the occaſion, and will ſay,<note place="margin">Note.</note> If ſuch and ſuch men take ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, then they hope they may take the ſame liberty as well as ſuch men doe; and therefore they run into the ſame courſe with all greedineſſe. This is that which the Lord complained of in the whole Church of <hi>Judah,</hi> Jer. 3.7, 8. <hi>Her treacherous ſiſter</hi> Judah <hi>ſaw it, and though for all the cauſes whereby back-ſliding</hi> Iſrael <hi>committed Adultery I had put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and given her a divorce,</hi> yet <hi>her treacherous ſiſter</hi> Judah <hi>feared not, but went and played the Harlot alſo.</hi> You heard one uſe that we ought to make of our brethrens failings was, that we ſhould thereby become to feare, but ſhe ſaw the fall of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and would not be reformed, ſhe feared not, ſhe was not humbled at ſuch falls of her Siſter Church, but was <hi>wanton her ſelfe,</hi> and went and <hi>played the Harlot alſo.</hi> As
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:117852:128"/>the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had gone a whoring after falſe gods, <hi>Iudah</hi> ſaw her ſinne, and ſaw me reprove and afflict her for it, yet ſhe feared not, but went and played the Harlot; to ſhew you, that a man may ſee his brothers ſinne, priding himſelfe in his better watching over himſelfe, or with a wanton eye; and this kinde of obſerving the falls of our brethren we ought not to make uſe of, he pre-ſuppoſeth a man ought to obſerve and ſee his brothers ſinne, but not with any of theſe eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. But for further uſe, learne we from hence not to neglect the falls of our brethren, and thinke it is good for us, neither to meddle nor make with them, let that be farre from us; that was the ſpirit of <hi>Caine,</hi> Gen. 4.6. <hi>Am I my brothers Keeper?</hi> as if he would neither meddle nor make with him, what had he to doe with him? now this is a churliſh and an unnaturall frame of ſpirit, for a man not to be ſenſible of anothers failings. We ſhould looke at every mans failing, as things that behoove us to obſerve, and as much as in us lyes rather to prevent them then not to take notice of them. Many a man thinkes it is beſt to live quietly, and let every man ſay, and doe as he will, but this is not that which the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> would have to be in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly, Let it be our parts therefore to take a due obſervation not only of our owne, but alſo of the ſteps of our brethren, we ſhould not hide our ſelves from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of them, if we be occaſioned to ſee it, we ſhould not blinde our ſelves, and put out our eyes, you ſee that love to our brethren, and enemies beaſt, would require it, if we finde them out of the way, or fallen downe under their burthen; and you ſee God requires this love to our ſelves, that we ſhould make ſome uſe to our ſelves of our brethrens fall.</p>
            <p>As firſt, if you ſee a brother ſinne, whatever ſinne it be, learne we to feare God, and that is true Chriſtian affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be firſt affected with an holy feare of your owne weakneſſe; we ſhould be jealous of the ſinfull frame of our owne hearts, that doubtleſſe of themſelves are as apt to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:117852:128"/>ſtart aſide as any of our brethrens be, the want of this (as you heard) <hi>Ieremiah</hi> reproved in <hi>Iudah;</hi> and this <hi>Paul</hi> required of the Romans, <hi>Be not high minded, but feare;</hi> and what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges hath the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> above others? the Apoſtle knew that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had not received an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of errour in his time; he made account in his time, if that <hi>Iſrael</hi> (which <hi>was the naturall branch</hi>) <hi>were cut off,</hi> then <hi>be not thou high minded, but feare,</hi> for if they be cut off, why maiſt not thou? Firſt therefore lay we our hands upon our owne hearts, and ſee if there be not the like folly in me, the ſame roote of unbeleefe in me, or if I be not led to the ſame, am not I led to as great, or a greater evill then theirs is? This uſe ſhould we make to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Againe, we ſhould labour to make benefit to our ſelves by it, looke at your brethren in this caſe, with ſuch an eye as may ſtirre you up the more to pitty them; if they be gone out of the way call him back againe, if he lye under his burthen lift him up, or if his eſtate and condition be ſuch, as that you can by no meanes have opportunity to ſpeake to him, or if you ſhould, happily your labour would be in vaine; and if you ſhould faile here and cannot reach him, yet whether he will or no you may power out your ſoules to God in his behalfe, and ſo may you doe him good; we ought ſo to doe, and not to faile therein; and that will be of ſpeciall uſe to helpe us this way; to heare of the ſinnes and falls of our brethren is much, but to ſee them is more; to ſee ſuch heavie burthens lye upon his ſoule that he is not able to ſubſiſt, in ſuch a caſe as this, there will be a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all compaſſion kindled in the heart of a living Chriſtian; for <hi>living Chriſtians are loving Chriſtians, ſo farre as living ſo farre loving, for the whole life of Chriſtianity is but faith towards God, and love towards our brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But ſay you, you would not have us to ſhut our eyes upon the failings of our brethren, but to ſee and obſerve them; but doth not the Holy Ghoſt ſay,</hi> Love covereth a multitude of ſinnes? <hi>as if we ſhould ſmother them, neither meddle nor make with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But yet though love cover a multitude of ſins, yet
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:117852:129"/>how doth it cover them? Firſt, with a mantle of wiſdome, then with a mantle of faithfulneſſe, and then a mantle of compaſſion.</p>
            <p>A mantle of wiſdome, when a man ſo covers it as not to skin it over,<note place="margin">Mantle of wiſdome.</note> but to cover it ſo effectually as that it may be covered from the eyes of God and man, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.19, 20. this is a wiſe covering of a multitude of ſinnes, when a man takes a courſe not only to cover them from the eyes of men, but principally from the Conſcience of the ſinner himſelfe, as that in time he be not over-preſſed with them, and then when he is leaſt able to beare them, and ſo endanger wholly to over-whelme him; for let a man goe on in ſinne, he goes on from day to day, and thinkes himſelfe fiſh whole, and yet it is neither covered from Gods eye, nor from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſuch a ſoule, and in the end it cannot but ſee it, and then ſo bitterly bewaile it, that it is much to be feared he will be quite over-whelmed with it. And therefore, this a man muſt have principall reſpect unto, principally to cover his ſinne from Gods eye; and that it may likewiſe be ſo covered, as not to be ſmothered and dawbed, but cover it with an healing Plaiſter, ſo as that in time it may be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, that no ſprig of ſuch a ſinne may remaine there, not a mantle of flattery, but healing; ſuch as whereby they may be carefull to take a courſe, that ſuch evils may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſome corriſive Plaiſter.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Mantle of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> with a mantle of faithfulneſſe, not to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſinnes of others further then will be of neceſſity for the healing of them. If a man be fallen under his burthen, or under his beaſt, and he is not able himſelfe to helpe him up, he muſt then call them that are of ſtrength, and may be of uſe to helpe a man in ſuch a caſe, ſo that if in this caſe, if a mans integrity of heart tells him, that he aymes at no more in making knowne his brethrens failings, but to helpe his brother out of thoſe falls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.13. When a man reveales a matter no further then to gather helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him, it is well; but becauſe there is <hi>a ſnare in that,</hi> a man had need be wary, for a man may reveale it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion and ſcorne, and then though a man ſhould ſpeake it
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:117852:129"/>to them that are able to helpe him, it would be a ſinne to him, as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.22, 23, <hi>Noah</hi> being drunk, and his nakedneſſe diſcovered, <hi>Cam</hi> comming and ſeeing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus naked, he in a deriding manner, goes forth, and tells his other two brethren, when as he might himſelf have covered his nakedneſſe, but he doth it not, but goes forth and acquaints them, and they do what they can to cover it, they goe backward, and drawes a garment upon him, <hi>And when he awoke,</hi> he by a ſpirit of propheſie knowing what was done, he ſaid, <hi>curſed be Cam for ever,</hi> and he made him a ſervant to both his brethren, when it was in his power to have covered him but did not, but made a jeſt of it to his brethren, he was accurſed for it, but becauſe they in a modeſt reverent manner did cover him, a bleſſing fell upon them to this day.</p>
            <p>To ſhew you that God requires this faithfulneſſe in us in this caſe. If we be able to doe it our ſelves, we muſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, but doe it our ſelves and let it go no further; but if the burthen be too great, that he cannot lift it up, it is too weighty a matter for him, then he may call in thoſe that are able to help him in ſuch a work, ſo as that he do not ſpeak by way of deriſion, but rather with trouble of mind to ſee him thus foiled.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, So alſo a mantle of compaſſion,<note place="margin">Mantle of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſo as that if ſo be, that a mans brother be brought at length to ſee his failing, and to acknowledge it, and ſhall expreſſe himſelfe that it repents him he hath ſo done, both in offending God and his Brethren, then thou ſhalt forgive him, our Saviour ſaid ſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.4. and the like you read, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. ſo that when the Holy Ghoſt commends this as a property of love, <hi>that it covers a multitude of ſins,</hi> he meanes not that it covers them in ſilence, or forgetfulneſſe, or careleſneſſe, as if we never meant to meddle nor make with them, in a careleſſe ſilence, and in an indifferent putting of the matter from us, as if it nothing concerned us, but cover them by wiſdome, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and compaſſion, even ſuch as God for Chriſts ſake hath ſhewed to us.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But you ſay againe, but if a man be thus willing to ſee
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:117852:130"/>and obſerve the failings of his brethren. It may be he ſhall be counted a buſie body in other mens matters, a Biſhop in another mans Dioceſſe, meddling in matters that concerns him not, and makes us to do there, where we have nothing to doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We may be ſo counted, but it is not to be doing, where we have nothing to doe, for God would have us to take notice of one anothers failings, God and Chriſtian love requires it, it is not out of our element and charge, but God layes a charge upon us to keepe and looke to this and that mans ſoule. As it was ſaid to the King of <hi>Iſrael, keep this man, and if he be gone, thy ſoule ſhall goe for his ſoule.</hi> It is for us to keepe diligent watch, and to conſider one another, and to take heede, there bee not an evill heart of unbeleefe one in another, and therefore wee muſt not onely have reſpect to the wayes, and words of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but to the healing of their hearts to ſee there be no deceitfulnes in the bottome, God therefore requires that we ſhould exhort <hi>one another daily, while it is called to day,</hi> If therfore you do but keep your ſelves within theſe termes, not medl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other mens ſinnes, with an hypocriticall eye to condemne them and to juſtifie our ſelves; nor with a ſenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, envious, malicious, wanton eye, but with an eye of wiſdome, faithfulneſſe, and compaſſion, in ſuch a caſe you do not go beyond your Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But you ſay, I ſhall be more buſie, then I ſhall have thanke for my labour, I may bee worſe, and they never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be they will be the worſe for the while, and never the better, but <hi>he that rebuketh a man, afterwards ſhall find more favour, then he that flattereth with his tongue,</hi> Prov, 28.23. A man muſt ſow this ſeed in patience. It may be a winter wil follow upon it, but at length he ſhall find the fruits of his labours; even as the Husband-man waiteth with long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, til the ſeaſon and time of harveſt, yeeld him a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table increaſe, he that deales plainly with his neighbour, ſhall find more favor at the length then he that flatters him; If you looſe his favour, it is but for a ſeaſon, and if a man in this caſe have been more buſie then for the preſent he gets
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:117852:130"/>thankes for, yet God will bleſſe it, and recompence it, and God wil not let ſuch a man go without finding favour with himſelfe, how ever he may from others.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Vpon the ſight of a mans brothers ſin, a faithfull man is to pray for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any man ſee his brother ſin, let him aske,</hi> So did holy <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32.31, 32, 33. This was the firſt worke he had to doe upon their ſin, and he ſpent forty dayes and forty nights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that worke; when he ſaw it was a ſin, and puniſhed it as a Magiſtrate, he ſatisfies not himſelfe in ſo doing, but he gets to God, and wraſtles with him about it, and layes his owne ſoule to pawne to God, either <hi>pardon that ſinne,</hi> or if he do condemn them, condemn him with them. The like did God direct <hi>Iob</hi> to doe, he bids his three friends <hi>goe to</hi> Job, <hi>and he ſhall pray for you, him will I accept</hi> Job 42.7, 8. God would have it ſo, <hi>Iob</hi> muſt pray for them when he ſees them in a ſinne. And <hi>Ieremiah</hi> speaks to the ſame purpoſe, Chap. 13.17 <hi>My ſoule ſhall mourne and weep in ſecret for you,</hi> and the patterne of our Saviour is without exception, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34 happy was he that could doe him a miſcheife, and all men cried out <hi>away with him, crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> that when one would thinke a mans heart ſhould burſt with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he prayes to his father, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they doe,</hi> he prayes for pardon of their ſin, when they uſe him moſt wickedly, one that had never done them wrong. And ſo you read of <hi>Stephen,</hi> the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Martyr <hi>Act.</hi> 7 60. when they flung ſtones about his ears, <hi>he kneeled down and cryed with a loud voyce; Lord lay not this ſinne to their charge.</hi>

It is firſt taken from the compaſſion which we owe to our brethrrn, we ought to pray for them if they had been but ſick, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.13. <hi>When they were ſick I mourned for them, my prayer ſhall be for them in their miſery.</hi> Now if a man ſhould pray for men in any calamity, how much more in this, the greateſt of all the reſt, we ought moſt to pray for our Brethren when they ſinne.</p>

Taken from the duty that lyes upon a Chriſtian to exhort his brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, 13. and <hi>Levit,</hi> 19.17. and neither of theſe can prevaile without prayer, for this as wel as any thing elſe is ſanctified <hi>by the Word and prayer,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Taken from the deſperate danger of ſin, and the helpleſneſſe of a man under ſinne, unleſſe God put in; and therefore in ſome caſe though if man be too weake, he may call in others to help, yet however amongſt the reſt call for Gods help, for unleſſe we doe ſo, all helps without him are in vaine; though good helpes are of ſpeciall uſe, God bleſſing them to ſave and lift up a poore ſoule out of ſin, but know this, that it is a worke of an Almighty power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a ſoule from ſinne no leſſe then the Redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He redeemes Iſrael from all his iniquities, Pſal,</hi> 1 30. <hi>laſt,</hi> unleſſe he put forth a redeeming hand, there will be no good done, there is ſuch a deceitfulneſſe in ſin, as that it will harden a man. Sinne is of the nature of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it ſtiffens and hardens the body, puts out the eyes, and ſo inflames it with heate, that it is not poſſible to quench it; ſo when a man hath once ſinned againſt God, he preſently looſeth his eyes, Satan and his Luſts having gotten him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne, they firſt put out his eyes, that he ſhall ſee no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nor hurt in it, and then he is ſo hardened with the ſin he hath committed, that no counſels or admonitions can recover him out of it, but only the mighty hand of God, and therefore prayer muſt be made to God for him.</p>

Taken from the diſpleaſure that God takes, if he ſee that we doe not pray for them, when we forget to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them before the Lord, this is ill taken, God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed when there is none to <hi>ſtand in the gap</hi> in ſuch a caſe as this, <hi>Eſa,</hi> 59.15, 16. <hi>God doth not afflict willingly,</hi> and yet if he be ſtirred up he muſt deſtroy them, if there be none to ſtand in the gap; you then provoke the wrath of the Lord, and this diſpleaſeth him much, and God may juſtly leave us to the like ſinne for which we are not humbled in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

We ſhall have comfort in their comfort, becauſe we did mourne in their griefe. If Gods people can mourne with their brethren in ſinne and miſery. <hi>God will reſtore comfort to them, and to their mourners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we make uſe of this point, come we to the next.</p>
            <p>Doct. 3. <hi>A faithfull Chriſtian, praying for his brethren faln into any ſin, ſhall obtaine peace, and pardon, and grace for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid ſo in the text, <hi>If any man;</hi> that is, any man that beleeves in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he ſhall aske, and he ſhall give him life</hi> So that you ſee here is the promiſe made to ſuch, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, that <hi>upon asking, he ſhall give life</hi> to his ſinfull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Who ſhall <hi>give him life?</hi> Interpreters take it both wayes, and both agreeable to the text, and the Analogie of faith; for whether he that prayes be as an Inſtrument, or God, it is all one, for it muſt be God that doth it, and he that prayes is an Inſtrument, he procures to his ſinning brother great favour from God.</p>
            <p>Life] that is, the life of <hi>Iuſtification,,</hi> and of <hi>Sanctification</hi> conſolation and comfort to his ſoule notwithſtanding his ſinne; the promiſe is evident, he ſhall prevaile with God, to beſtow life upon his brother. This you ſhall ſee evident from Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>I fell downe before the Lord forty dayes, and forty nights, &amp;c.</hi> and thereupon the Lord did ſhew mercy, and pardoned their ſin. <hi>Iob</hi> prayed for his friends, and the Lord ſaid he would <hi>accept him,</hi> Job 42.8, 9. And ſo our Saviour, <hi>he prayed for his crucifiers.</hi> And it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thought, that the powerfull prevalency of <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon in converting three thouſand ſoules at once, did
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:117852:132"/>eſpecially ſpring from our Saviours prayer, and the efficacy of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. And <hi>Stephen,</hi> he prayed for his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and <hi>Paul</hi> was one of them that had an hand in his death, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.6. And yet ere long God anſwered <hi>Stephens</hi> prayer in converting <hi>Saul;</hi> ſo that let a man (a beleeving Chriſtian) pray for his ſinning brother, and he ſhall give him life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. It is taken from the pleaſure that God takes to knit the Members of the Body of his Son together, and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means to joyne us together, and ſo fitly to make us uſeful Members one to another then this, thoſe members of the body that are moſt weak ſhould be moſt helped this way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 21, 22. <hi>Every member</hi> ſhould be of ſome uſe one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it doth better compact the body together. God did not ſay to <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, Goe you and pray for your ſelves, but, <hi>Goe to my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>and he ſhall pray for you</hi> He would have them beholden to <hi>Iob,</hi> of whom they had ſpoken the thing that was not right, elſe God would not accept them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. It is taken from the <hi>Interceſſion of Chriſt,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes that office for every member of his body: <hi>This ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour have all his Saints;</hi> though they doe not merit this by their prayers, yet there is this efficacy in their prayers, not of merit, but of grace, to prevaile with the Father in their brethrens behalfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Interceſſion is ſuch a part and kinde of prayer as a man makes for other men, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure favour from God to them, to be Mediators for them, to pray for others in the name and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, and that for his ſake they may be accepted, God will then heare us for Chriſts ſake in the behalfe of our brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. It may be a ground of much encouragement to every Chriſtian man, to wraſtle earneſtly with God in the behalfe of his brethren, when you ſee them <hi>ſinne a ſinne that is not unto death,</hi> be it a mans <hi>wicked covetouſneſſe,</hi> and ſuch as a man is froward in it, and wil by no meanes be admoniſhed, and goe on reſolutely in it, yet in this caſe God expects and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires we ſhould mourne for him, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.17, 18. and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:117852:132"/>therefore neglect not to pray for your brethren in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it will diſpleaſe God if you pray not for them, is it nothing to you to paſſe by, and to ſee ſuch a man lye in ſinne? aſſure your ſelf of this, Gods heart will fit looſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, if your hearts ſit looſe to your brethren, and therefore neglect not to pray for them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if you pray for them you ſhall have comfort reſtored to them, and to your ſelves with them, and though for the preſent you might ſeeme to procure hurt to your ſelves, and no good to them, yet pray, and pray heartily, and uſe the beſt meanes you can, and you will ſurely finde the comfort and benefit of it; may not this be a notable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to you this way, that God ſhould be pleaſed to make thee an Inſtrument of <hi>life to thy brother,</hi> when he is a dead man in Gods ſight; a dead man will be ſtiffe, and cold, and putrifie, and yet even ſuch a man if thou prayeſt for him, thou ſhalt give him life to his ſoule.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>You ſay, But doth not many a man pray for his brethren, and yet is not heard and accepted, did not</hi> Abraham <hi>pray for</hi> Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael? <hi>And what think you of</hi> Samuels <hi>prayer for</hi> Saul, <hi>and yet ſaith God,</hi> How long wilt thou mourn for <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.6. <hi>I have caſt him off, mourne no more for him; ſo that ſometimes a man may pray for his brethren, and that earneſtly, and yet his prayers fall to the ground in vaine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it would be conſidered whether <hi>a man be a brother or no; Abraham</hi> did not pray for one that was already gracious, that did belong to the election of grace, and the text doth not reach to ſuch a brother; but I underſtand it of ſuch as are either called, or belong to the election.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppoſe you doe not know whether he belong to the election of grace or no, it may be you pray for them whom you have not uſed other means to heal them, I doubt not but <hi>David</hi> prayed for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>Adonijah,</hi> but not uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other meanes, his prayers are rejected, theſe are not prayers of faith, when other good means are not uſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Its poſſible that a man may pray without <hi>faith,</hi> and without <hi>fervency,</hi> Jam. 5.15. and ſuch requeſts
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:117852:133"/>ſhould be faithfull and fervent, and God requires you ſhould come before him, and ſubmit your ſelves to him, and acknowledge your owne unworthineſſe to aske ſuch a bleſſing, and yet in the name of Chriſt you preſſe God with it, and you muſt walke cloſe with God in a courſe of Chriſtianity, elſe your prayers are to no purpoſe; and to waite on God through Chriſt for a gracious acceptance, and God will recompence your prayers, and labour of love in due time.</p>
